  "logline": "A prized courtesan on the eve of her sale risks everything in a dangerous game of Go against a wealthy merchant, gambling her only chance at freedom to pursue a love she's only known from afar.",
  "synopsis": "In the gilded cage of Lu Xian, the most prestigious brothel in the region, Mei has been raised as a living treasure—educated in poetry, trained in seduction, and groomed for a life of elegant servitude. Now of age, she faces her inevitable purchase, with a powerful military general and a wealthy merchant vying for ownership of her future. Yet from her terrace, Mei has spent years watching Lin, a humble florist whose tender devotion to his flowers has taught her what genuine love might look like—patient, nurturing, freely given.\n\nDesperate to seize control of her destiny, Mei approaches the gambling-prone merchant Min Zhu with an audacious wager: a game of Go where victory means her freedom. Outmatched in strategy, she draws upon every lesson of her training, using her arts not to seduce but to survive, clouding his judgment long enough to claim an impossible victory. As the merchant pays for her freedom with his own money, Mei sends a letter to the florist she has loved in secret, confessing her devotion and her hope.\n\nWith bare feet and wild hair, Mei runs through the evening streets to Lin's shop, where he sits reading her words by lantern light. When he opens his door to find her standing there—no longer a jewel in a gilded box but a woman choosing her own path—two strangers finally meet, and Mei discovers whether love observed can become love lived.",
  "themes": "Freedom and self-determination, the commodification of women, love as tender cultivation versus possession, the courage to risk everything for authenticity",
  "world_rules": "Set in historical China during a period of rigid social hierarchy, where courtesans occupy a complex position—celebrated for their artistic refinements yet ultimately property to be bought and sold. The brothel Lu Xian operates under strict codes: Madame Chou controls all transactions, courtesans may accumulate personal savings through performances, and a woman's worth is determined by her training, beauty, and virginity. Go serves as both entertainment and serious gambling among the merchant class, with wagers considered binding contracts of honor. The florist trade represents honest, humble labor—a world entirely separate from the perfumed halls of pleasure houses, yet visible from Mei's terrace, symbolizing the ordinary life forever denied to women of her station.",
  "lighting": "Golden hour warmth and soft lantern glow contrasted with cool blue moonlight; intimate candlelit interiors with silk-filtered light creating sensual shadows; natural daylight streaming through wooden lattice screens",
  "vibe": "Intimate, yearning, delicate, quietly defiant, romantically melancholic",

      "name": "Mei",
      "role": "protagonist",
      "description": "Mei possesses an ethereal, porcelain beauty that stops hearts and empties purses. She stands at modest height with a willowy, graceful build, her posture impeccable from years of training yet somehow still suggesting vulnerability. Her hair is lustrous black silk that falls past her waist when unbound, usually arranged in elaborate styles adorned with jade pins. Her eyes are dark pools of intelligence and carefully concealed longing, almond-shaped and framed by naturally curved lashes. Her skin is pale as moonlight, unblemished and soft, her lips naturally rose-tinted. Her hands are her most expressive feature—small, elegant, trained to pour tea and play instruments with equal artistry."

      "role": "love_interest",
      "description": "Lin possesses a quiet handsomeness that reveals itself slowly, like a flower opening. He stands at average height with a lean, wiry build earned through physical labor rather than martial training. His shoulders are broad but he holds them modestly, as if apologizing for taking up space. His hair is simple black, worn in a practical topknot that often comes loose, with strands falling across his forehead. His eyes are warm brown, crinkled at the corners from squinting in sunlight, remarkably kind and observant. His skin is healthy bronze from outdoor work, his hands rough with calluses yet impossibly gentle. A small scar marks his left thumb from a pruning accident. He radiates an aura of peaceful contentment."

      "description": "Min Zhu cuts an imposing figure of cultivated prosperity. He is tall and substantial, carrying extra weight that speaks of abundant living rather than sloth, with the confident posture of a man accustomed to being the most important person in any room. His hair is still mostly black, silvering at the temples, worn in an elaborate topknot secured with gold pins. His face is round and shrewd, with calculating eyes that miss nothing of monetary value, a well-groomed beard, and lips that curl easily into satisfied smiles. His skin is pale and soft, protected from labor and sun. His hands are manicured, adorned with jade rings. He projects an aura of absolute material confidence."

      "description": "Madame Chou carries herself with the absolute authority of a woman who has survived and thrived in a brutal world. She is of medium height but seems taller through sheer presence, her figure still graceful though fuller with age. Her hair is silver-streaked black, always immaculately styled in elaborate arrangements that took an hour to achieve. Her face is a masterwork of preserved beauty—high cheekbones, intelligent eyes lined with experience, lips that have forgotten how to smile without calculation. Her skin shows age gracefully, powdered and cared for. Her hands are elegant but strong, capable of tenderness and cruelty in equal measure. She projects an aura of absolute control."

He stands tall and broad, his body a weapon maintained through decades of training, carrying himself with the rigid posture of military command. His hair is iron-gray, cropped short and practical beneath his topknot. His face is a map of campaigns—a scar across his left cheek from a sword, another through his eyebrow, features blunt and weathered by sun and wind. His eyes are hard and assessing, always scanning for threats. His skin is dark from years of outdoor command, his hands calloused from weapons. He projects an aura of contained danger, a sword barely sheathed."

She is small and slight, barely reaching Mei's shoulder, with the hunched posture of someone accustomed to making herself smaller. Her hair is simple black, pulled back in a plain bun, practical and unremarkable. Her face is pleasant but ordinary—round cheeks, small nose, eyes that are kind but trained to look down. Her skin is rougher than the courtesans', marked by work. Her hands are red and chapped from washing. She moves through spaces like a ghost, noticed only when needed, carrying an aura of gentle competence."
