*A prized courtesan on the eve of her sale risks everything in a dangerous game of Go against a wealthy merchant, gambling her only chance at freedom to pursue a love she's only known from afar.*


## Scene 1:
A private balcony overlooking the Street of Flowering Commerce

The first light of morning spilled across [LOC_PRESSED_DIRT_ROAD] like honey poured from a celestial jar, gilding the cobblestones and catching the dew that clung to [PROP_FLOWER_CART] wheels below. [CHAR_MEI] pressed her palm against the cool wooden railing of her patio, her silk sleeping robe pooling at her bare feet as she watched the familiar figure emerge from [LOC_FLORIST_SHOP].

[CHAR_LIN] moved among his blooms with the reverence of a scholar handling ancient texts. His hands—rough from soil and honest work—cupped a [PROP_ORCHID_POT] as though cradling something newborn. He whispered to the pale petals, words [CHAR_MEI] could never hear but somehow understood. She had memorized the rhythm of his mornings: first the orchids, then the jasmine, then the stubborn chrysanthemums that refused to flourish without his patient coaxing.

She had never spoken to him. Never descended those stairs to stand among his flowers. Yet she knew him—knew the slight limp in his left leg after long days, knew how he tilted his face toward the sun when he thought no one watched, knew the way his shoulders curved protectively over damaged stems.

Behind her, [LOC_LU_XIAN_BROTHEL] stirred to life. Servants' footsteps echoed through lacquered corridors. Somewhere, [CHAR_MADAME_CHOU] was already calculating, already preparing for the suitors who would arrive before noon.

Today was the day.

[CHAR_MEI]'s fingers tightened on the railing. Below, [CHAR_LIN] lifted his weathered face toward the sunrise, and for one breathless moment, his gaze seemed to drift upward—toward her window, toward her watching eyes.

She stepped back into shadow, heart hammering against her ribs like a caged bird.

In [CHAR_MADAME_CHOU]'s ledgers, [CHAR_MEI] was worth more than that entire street of shops. She was [LOC_LU_XIAN_BROTHEL]'s finest jewel, polished for purchase.

But watching [CHAR_LIN] tend his flowers with such tenderness, she understood what she truly wanted: to be cultivated, not collected.

## Scene 2:
The preparation chamber, walls lined with lacquered cabinets and bronze mirrors

The ivory comb caught in [CHAR_MEI]'s hair, and [CHAR_SERVANT_GIRL] murmured an apology, her small fingers working to free the tangle. In the bronze mirror, [CHAR_MEI] watched [CHAR_MADAME_CHOU] pace behind them, her silk robes whispering against the polished floor like conspirators sharing secrets.

"[CHAR_GENERAL_ZHOA] arrived at dawn," [CHAR_MADAME_CHOU] announced, her voice carrying the practiced warmth of a merchant appraising jade. "He brought soldiers. Twelve of them, standing in my courtyard like we're a fortress to be conquered."

[CHAR_MEI] said nothing. [CHAR_SERVANT_GIRL]'s hands trembled slightly as she reached for the [PROP_ROUGE_POT].

"And [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]?" [CHAR_MEI] asked, keeping her tone light as spring rain.

[CHAR_MADAME_CHOU]'s reflection smiled—a sharp, knowing expression. "The merchant sends gifts instead of soldiers. Clever man. He understands that [LOC_LU_XIAN_BROTHEL_DIR_E] cannot be stormed." She lifted a [PROP_JADE_HAIRPIN] from its silk wrapping, turning it so light caught its translucent depths. "This arrived an hour ago. Worth more than most houses on [LOC_PRESSED_DIRT_ROAD]."

[CHAR_MEI] studied the hairpin without reaching for it. Somewhere beyond these walls, [CHAR_LIN] was watering his jasmine, speaking softly to roots and stems.

"You've taught me well, Mother," [CHAR_MEI] said, using the title all the girls used. "I know my worth."

[CHAR_MADAME_CHOU]'s eyes narrowed almost imperceptibly. "Do you, little flower?" She set the hairpin down with deliberate care. "Then you understand that today, your worth becomes someone else's treasure."

[CHAR_MEI] met her gaze in the mirror. "I understand perfectly."

## Scene 3:
The grand reception hall, crimson pillars rising toward painted ceilings depicting celestial maidens

[CHAR_GENERAL_ZHOA] stood like a monument carved from ambition, his ceremonial armor gleaming beneath the painted ceiling. Across the hall, [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] reclined on silk cushions, his merchant's robes pooling around him like spilled wine, a [PROP_JADE_FAN] moving lazily in his soft fingers.

Between them, [CHAR_MEI] knelt on the receiving platform, her face a perfect mask of demure attention.

"She plays the guqin like water over stones," [CHAR_GENERAL_ZHOA] declared, addressing [CHAR_MADAME_CHOU] while his eyes devoured [CHAR_MEI]. "My household requires refinement. Culture."

[CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s laughter was silk sliding over glass. "The General mistakes possession for appreciation. One does not hang a masterwork in a barracks."

"You would know about hanging things," [CHAR_GENERAL_ZHOA] growled. "Ledgers. Contracts. The trappings of men who've never held a sword."

[CHAR_MADAME_CHOU] raised one elegant hand. "Gentlemen. You honor [LOC_LU_XIAN_BROTHEL_DIR_N] with your presence."

[CHAR_MEI] watched [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s fingers tap against his fan—a gambler's tell, impatient beneath his languid exterior. She had seen such men before, those who collected beauty like currency, always calculating odds.

"Perhaps," [CHAR_MEI] spoke softly, "the honored merchant might demonstrate his famous skill at Go. I have heard tales of his victories."

[CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s eyes sharpened with sudden interest. [CHAR_GENERAL_ZHOA] scoffed, but the merchant leaned forward, seeing something new in the courtesan's downcast gaze.

"You play, precious flower?"

"Poorly," [CHAR_MEI] lied, her heart hammering with the first tremor of hope. "But I do so love to learn."

## Scene 4:
A modest wooden storefront overflowing with potted blooms and hanging baskets

[CHAR_LIN] knelt among the chrysanthemums, his calloused fingers pressing fresh soil around stems that had begun to droop in yesterday's heat. He spoke to them as he always did—soft encouragements, gentle scoldings—words meant for no human ear.

"You must drink," he murmured, tilting the [PROP_WATERING_CAN] with practiced care. "The sun takes, but I give back."

The shadow fell across his work before he heard the footsteps. [CHAR_LIN] looked up to find a young woman in servant's clothing, her eyes darting nervously between him and the street behind her.

"Are you the florist?" [CHAR_SERVANT_GIRL] asked, her voice barely above a whisper. "Lin Wei?"

He rose slowly, wiping soil on his worn trousers. "I am."

[CHAR_SERVANT_GIRL] pressed a [PROP_FOLDED_NOTE] into his hand, the paper fine and scented with something floral he couldn't name. "From my mistress. She begs you read it only when evening comes." Her eyes held something fierce beneath their timidity. "Please. It matters more than you know."

Before [CHAR_LIN] could speak, she vanished into the crowd of [LOC_PRESSED_DIRT_ROAD], leaving him standing among his blooms with mystery folded in his palm.

He turned the note over, studying the elegant brushwork of his own name. His gaze drifted upward, past the rooftops, toward the balcony of [LOC_LU_XIAN_BROTHEL] where morning light sometimes caught a figure watching.

[CHAR_LIN] tucked the note into his breast pocket, against his heart, and returned to his chrysanthemums with trembling hands.

## Scene 5:
Private quarters adorned with silk screens and a mahogany table bearing a wooden Go board

[CHAR_MIN_ZHU] settled onto the bamboo mat with the practiced ease of a man accustomed to comfort, his [PROP_JADE_FAN] clicking shut as he surveyed the [PROP_GO_BOARD] between them. His eyes held the gleam of a collector examining unexpected treasure.

"You summoned me privately," he observed, fingers trailing across the polished stones. "Bold, for a flower not yet plucked."

[CHAR_MEI] kept her hands folded in her lap, her voice steady as temple bells. "I wished to discuss terms, honored merchant. Terms [CHAR_MADAME_CHOU] need not know."

His interest sharpened visibly. "Go on."

She produced her [PROP_SAVINGS_POUCH], the silk worn from years of careful accumulation. "My earnings. Everything I possess. I wager it against myself—at discount—if you defeat me at Go." She paused, letting hunger bloom in his expression. "But if I win, you match my sum. I purchase my own freedom."

[CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s laughter filled the chamber, rich with condescension. "You would gamble your entire fate on a game you admitted playing poorly?"

"I am a courtesan," [CHAR_MEI] replied softly. "We are taught to underestimate ourselves in the presence of great men."

The flattery landed precisely where intended. He leaned forward, already tasting victory. "And if I simply refuse? Purchase you through [CHAR_MADAME_CHOU] as intended?"

"Then you gain a possession." [CHAR_MEI] met his gaze directly. "But accept my wager, and you gain a story—the night you won [LOC_LU_XIAN_BROTHEL]'s greatest jewel through wit alone."

[CHAR_MIN_ZHU] smiled, a predator's smile. "Tomorrow evening. Prepare to lose beautifully."

## Scene 6:
The back garden where seedlings grow in careful rows beneath a weathered trellis

The last customers had departed hours ago, leaving [CHAR_LIN] alone with the settling quiet of [LOC_FLORIST_SHOP_DIR_W]. He had waited as instructed, though the [PROP_FOLDED_NOTE] had burned against his chest all afternoon like a coal wrapped in silk.

Now, with evening painting the sky in shades of bruised plum, he finally allowed himself to unfold the paper.

The brushwork was exquisite—each character formed with the precision of someone trained in the highest arts. But it was the words themselves that stole the breath from his lungs.

*I have watched you tend your flowers for three years. I have seen how you speak to broken stems, how you shelter new growth from harsh winds. You do not know my name, but I know your heart through your hands.*

[CHAR_LIN] sank onto the wooden stool beside his potting bench, the note trembling in his calloused fingers.

*Tomorrow evening, I will play a game that determines my fate. Win or lose, I wanted you to know: someone sees you. Someone believes the gentleness you give to petals and roots is the rarest treasure in this city of merchants and soldiers.*

*If fortune favors me, I will come to your shop. Not as a customer. As a woman who wishes to learn how flowers grow.*

*If fortune does not favor me, remember that you brought beauty to my window when I had none of my own.*

*The woman on the balcony*

[CHAR_LIN] lifted his gaze toward [LOC_LU_XIAN_BROTHEL], its lanterns now glowing amber against the darkness. He had always known someone watched from that high window. He had told himself it meant nothing—a bored courtesan, a servant seeking distraction.

But she had seen him. Truly seen him.

His chest ached with something he had no name for, something that had lived dormant beneath years of solitary labor. He pressed the note flat against the workbench, smoothing its creases with the same reverence he showed his most delicate orchids.

"What game?" he whispered to the empty shop, to the flowers that held no answers. "What fate?"

The evening deepened around him, and [CHAR_LIN] remained motionless among his blooms, holding a stranger's hope in hands that suddenly understood they had always been waiting for exactly this.

## Scene 7:
Private quarters now arranged for the fateful game, lanterns casting warm pools of light across silk screens

The [PROP_GO_BOARD] gleamed between them like a battlefield awaiting blood. [CHAR_MEI] had arranged the lanterns herself, ensuring shadows would soften her features while illuminating [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s expressions—every flicker of triumph, every subtle tell.

He placed his first black stone with theatrical deliberation. "I dreamed of this moment," [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] murmured, his merchant's voice smooth as oiled silk. "The great jewel of [LOC_LU_XIAN_BROTHEL], believing she could outmaneuver me."

[CHAR_MEI] responded with white, her fingers steady despite the tremor in her heart. "Dreams often deceive, honored merchant."

The game unfolded like a flower opening to reveal thorns. [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] played with the patient cruelty of a man who had crushed countless opponents, each stone placement tightening an invisible noose. [CHAR_MEI] recognized his strategy—the same encirclement technique that had bankrupted rival houses across three provinces.

By the twentieth move, her territory had shrunk to desperate islands surrounded by his advancing black sea.

"You play better than poorly," [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] observed, genuine surprise coloring his condescension. "But not well enough."

[CHAR_MEI] studied the board, seeing her freedom slipping away stone by stone. Somewhere beyond these walls, [CHAR_LIN] had read her note. Somewhere, a gentle man tended flowers and waited for a woman who might never come.

Her hand hovered over the remaining white stones. The game was lost—she had known it would be. But [CHAR_MADAME_CHOU] had taught her that Go was merely one battlefield among many.

"Shall I pour tea?" [CHAR_MEI] asked softly, rising with fluid grace. "The game grows long."

## Scene 8:
Private quarters thick with incense and unspoken stakes, the Go board now showing Mei's desperate position

[CHAR_MEI] lifted the [PROP_TEA_POT] with practiced grace, moving behind [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] where he sat studying his imminent victory. Her fingers found the silk ribbon binding her hair—one gentle tug, and dark waves cascaded over her shoulder like water released from a dam.

The jasmine oil [CHAR_SERVANT_GIRL] had worked into her locks that morning drifted across [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s face. She felt him stiffen, his breath catching as she leaned forward to pour.

"You play magnificently," she murmured, letting her voice brush his ear like silk. Her chest pressed gently against his shoulder as amber tea filled his cup.

[CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s hand, reaching for his next stone, hesitated. "You are... most gracious in defeat."

"Am I defeated?" [CHAR_MEI] allowed her hair to sweep across his neck as she straightened, returning to her position with deliberate slowness. She had been trained for this—every gesture calculated, every breath a weapon. [CHAR_MADAME_CHOU] had taught her that men who conquered in business often crumbled before the battlefield of intimacy.

She settled onto her cushion, meeting his gaze with eyes that promised nothing and everything.

[CHAR_MIN_ZHU] placed his stone, but his fingers trembled almost imperceptibly. His next move—she saw it instantly—was wrong. Aggressive where he should have been patient, distracted by flesh when he should have focused on territory.

"Your turn, precious flower," he said, his merchant's composure cracking at the edges.

[CHAR_MEI] placed her white stone precisely where his mistake had opened a path. The board shifted. Not victory—not yet—but possibility, blooming like [CHAR_LIN]'s stubborn chrysanthemums refusing to die.

## Scene 9:
Private quarters where lantern light flickers across the Go board, shadows dancing on silk screens

The [PROP_GO_BOARD] had transformed. Where black stones once strangled white territory, [CHAR_MEI]'s careful placements now carved breathing room through [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s formations. His distraction had cost him three crucial moves, and she had exploited each one with precision learned from years of watching [CHAR_MADAME_CHOU] negotiate with powerful men.

[CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s [PROP_JADE_FAN] lay forgotten beside him, his merchant's mask crumbling as he counted territory with increasingly frantic eyes. "This is... you planned this."

"I learned from observing great strategists," [CHAR_MEI] replied softly, placing another white stone. Her voice remained demure even as her heart thundered against her ribs. "Men who believe they have already won often stop fighting."

He reached for a black stone, then withdrew his hand. Reached again. The board offered no salvation—every path she had left him led to smaller territory, diminished returns. The mathematics of Go were unforgiving, and they now spoke in her favor.

"You used yourself as a piece," [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] whispered, something between admiration and fury coloring his words. "Your own body, a distraction."

[CHAR_MEI] met his gaze steadily. "I used what I was taught. What men like you paid to cultivate in me."

The silence stretched between them like silk pulled taut. Finally, [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] placed his stone in resignation—a defensive move that conceded the game's outcome.

"You have won, precious flower." His voice carried the bitterness of a collector watching treasure slip through his fingers. "Your freedom is purchased."

[CHAR_MEI]'s hands trembled as she bowed, tears she refused to shed burning behind her eyes. Somewhere across [LOC_PRESSED_DIRT_ROAD], a florist waited among his blooms.

## Scene 10:
Private quarters now heavy with the aftermath of victory, scattered Go stones catching lantern light

The door slid open before [CHAR_MEI] could rise from her cushion. [CHAR_MADAME_CHOU] entered like winter arriving early, her silk robes rustling with barely contained fury. Behind her, [CHAR_SERVANT_GIRL] hovered in the corridor, eyes wide with fearful hope.

"You wagered yourself." [CHAR_MADAME_CHOU]'s voice cut through the incense-thick air. "Without my knowledge. Without my permission."

[CHAR_MIN_ZHU] stood, brushing invisible dust from his merchant's robes. "The flower outplayed me, Madame. A binding wager, witnessed by honor." His smile held poison. "I am a man of my word, even in defeat."

[CHAR_MEI] rose slowly, her legs unsteady beneath her. "Mother, I—"

"Do not." [CHAR_MADAME_CHOU] raised one trembling hand. For a moment, her carefully constructed mask slipped, revealing something raw beneath—not anger, but loss. "You were my finest work. My legacy."

"I was your merchandise," [CHAR_MEI] replied softly, the words gentle as falling petals. "You taught me to know my worth. I finally learned."

[CHAR_MIN_ZHU] produced the [PROP_SAVINGS_POUCH] and his own matching sum, placing both on the [PROP_GO_BOARD] like offerings on an altar. "The transaction is complete. She belongs to herself now."

[CHAR_MADAME_CHOU] stared at the coins—freedom measured in copper and silver. When she finally spoke, her voice had aged decades. "Then go, little flower. Before I remember I should hate you for this."

[CHAR_MEI] bowed deeply, tears finally escaping down her painted cheeks. She gathered the coins with hands that would never again pour tea for men who owned her.

## Scene 11:
The Street of Flowering Commerce, now quiet under a canopy of stars

The cobblestones of [LOC_PRESSED_DIRT_ROAD_DIR_W] felt different beneath [CHAR_MEI]'s silk slippers—no longer the street she had watched from above, but solid ground that belonged to her now as much as anyone. The [PROP_SAVINGS_POUCH], heavy with her purchased freedom, pressed against her hip with each step. She had left behind her painted face, her elaborate robes, her jeweled hairpins. What remained was simply a woman walking toward a promise she had made to herself.

[LOC_FLORIST_SHOP] glowed with a single lantern in its window, amber light spilling across the [PROP_FLOWER_CART] and the potted blooms arranged along the storefront. [CHAR_MEI] stopped three paces from the door, her courage suddenly failing her.

What if he had not understood her note? What if he had understood and found her presumptuous—a courtesan daring to imagine herself worthy of a craftsman's honest affection?

The door opened before she could flee.

[CHAR_LIN] stood in the threshold, his work-roughened hands still bearing traces of soil, his simple cotton tunic creased from hours of waiting. He looked at her the way he looked at his orchids—with wonder, with careful attention, with the patience of someone who understood that beautiful things required time.

"You came," he said softly. His voice was exactly as she had imagined it would be.

"I won." [CHAR_MEI]'s words emerged barely above a whisper. "I am... I belong to myself now."

[CHAR_LIN] stepped aside, gesturing toward the warm interior of [LOC_FLORIST_SHOP]. "Then perhaps you would like to see how flowers grow? I could teach you, if you wished."

She crossed the threshold, and the scent of jasmine and chrysanthemum enveloped her like an embrace. The shop was small, cluttered with [PROP_WATERING_CAN]s and ceramic pots and seedlings reaching toward the light. It held none of [LOC_LU_XIAN_BROTHEL]'s grandeur, none of its calculated beauty.

It was perfect.

"I watched you," [CHAR_MEI] admitted, turning to face him. "Every morning. Every evening. I watched you speak to your flowers."

"I know." [CHAR_LIN]'s weathered face softened with something like reverence. "I always felt your eyes. I told myself it meant nothing, but I—" He paused, searching for words that had never come easily. "I spoke to the flowers because I could not speak to you."

[CHAR_MEI] reached out, her fingers brushing the petals of a [PROP_ORCHID_POT] resting on his workbench. "Will you teach me to make things grow?"

[CHAR_LIN] moved beside her, close enough that she could feel the warmth radiating from his simple clothes. His hand covered hers gently, guiding her touch along the orchid's stem with the same tenderness she had observed from her distant balcony.

"It begins with patience," he said quietly. "And believing that something small can become something beautiful, if only someone cares enough to try."

## Scene 12:
The back garden where seedlings grow in careful rows beneath a weathered trellis, now silvered by moonlight

They had moved to the garden without deciding to, drawn by the cool night air and the silver light that transformed [CHAR_LIN]'s modest rows of seedlings into something ethereal. [CHAR_MEI] sat on an overturned crate, her silk robes incongruous among the clay pots and scattered soil, while [CHAR_LIN] knelt beside a tray of struggling jasmine cuttings.

"These ones nearly died last week," he said softly, his fingers checking the soil moisture with practiced care. "Too much sun. I moved them here, where the trellis gives shade in the afternoon."

[CHAR_MEI] watched his hands—the same hands she had observed from her balcony, now close enough to touch. "How did you know they needed shade?"

"Their leaves told me." [CHAR_LIN] glanced up, a shy smile crossing his weathered features. "They curled inward, protecting themselves. Living things show their pain, if you learn to look."

The words settled between them like petals falling on still water. [CHAR_MEI] understood he was speaking of more than flowers.

"I never learned to show mine," she admitted quietly. "At [LOC_LU_XIAN_BROTHEL], pain was weakness. We were taught to smile through everything."

[CHAR_LIN] rose slowly, brushing soil from his knees. He moved to sit on another crate, close enough that their shoulders nearly touched. "You don't have to smile now. Not for me."

[CHAR_MEI] felt something loosen in her chest—a knot she had carried so long she had forgotten it existed. "I don't know how to be anything else. I was shaped for performance, for pleasing. What am I, if not that?"

"You are the woman who watched me speak to flowers." [CHAR_LIN]'s voice held no judgment, only wonder. "You are someone who saw gentleness and wanted it for herself. That is not nothing."

She turned to look at him fully, seeing the lines around his eyes, the gray threading through his hair, the quiet strength of a man who had never sought to conquer anything. "I wagered everything on a stranger."

"Not a stranger." He reached toward a nearby [PROP_ORCHID_POT], adjusting its position in the moonlight. "You knew me. Better, perhaps, than anyone who has walked through my shop in twenty years."

[CHAR_MEI] understood then what she had truly won—not just freedom from [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] or [CHAR_GENERAL_ZHOA], but freedom to be seen without performance, to exist without calculation. The night air carried the scent of jasmine and possibility.

"Will you teach me?" she asked again, but the question had deepened. "Not just flowers. How to live without... without being someone's treasure."

[CHAR_LIN] finally met her eyes, and she saw her own uncertainty reflected there—two people who had never believed they deserved tenderness, now offering it to each other.

"We could learn together," he said simply. "I've never been anyone's treasure either."

[CHAR_MEI] smiled—not the practiced smile of a courtesan, but something raw and real that ached in its unfamiliarity. In the moonlit garden of [LOC_FLORIST_SHOP_DIR_W], surrounded by growing things, she began to believe that she, too, might bloom.

## Scene 13:
The familiar balcony, now viewed from below as dawn breaks over the Street of Flowering Commerce

The first light of morning spilled across [LOC_PRESSED_DIRT_ROAD] like honey poured from a celestial jar, gilding the cobblestones just as it had on countless dawns before. But now [CHAR_MEI] stood among the blooms of [LOC_FLORIST_SHOP], her hands buried in rich soil, her simple cotton dress bearing the honest stains of her new craft.

She glanced upward toward [LOC_MEI_BEDROOM_PATIO_DIR_S], where silk curtains stirred in the morning breeze. Another girl lived there now—another jewel being polished for purchase. The thought brought a pang of sorrow, but no longer the desperate longing of a caged bird.

"The chrysanthemums need moving," [CHAR_LIN] said softly, appearing beside her with the [PROP_WATERING_CAN]. His shoulder brushed hers with easy familiarity. "Too much morning sun."

[CHAR_MEI] smiled—the real smile she had learned in moonlit gardens and quiet conversations. "Their leaves are curling. I noticed yesterday."

Pride flickered across his weathered features. "You see them now. Truly see them."

She wiped soil from her fingers, studying the calloused palms that had once known only silk and Go stones. Three months of honest work had transformed them, just as three months of genuine affection had transformed her heart.

"I dreamed of this," she admitted quietly. "Watching from up there, I imagined what it would feel like to stand among growing things."

[CHAR_LIN] set down the [PROP_WATERING_CAN] and took her hands in his—rough meeting rough now, equals in labor and love. "And does it feel as you imagined?"

[CHAR_MEI] looked around the modest shop, at the [PROP_ORCHID_POT]s she had learned to tend, at the jasmine cuttings she had coaxed back from near-death, at the man who had taught her that gentleness was not weakness.

"Better," she whispered. "Because I am not watching anymore. I am living."

Above them, the empty balcony caught the rising sun. Below, [CHAR_MEI] turned back to her chrysanthemums, speaking softly to their curling leaves as [CHAR_LIN] had taught her—words of encouragement, of patience, of love.

She had been cultivated once, shaped into someone else's treasure. Now she cultivated in return, and in the growing, she finally bloomed.
