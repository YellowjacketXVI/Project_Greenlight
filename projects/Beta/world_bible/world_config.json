  "synopsis": "Mei, the prized courtesan of the prestigious Lu Xian brothel, has been groomed in the arts of intellect, seduction, and pleasure under the watchful eye of Madame Chou. As she comes of age, two powerful suitors vie for her purchase: the high-ranking General Zhao and the wealthy merchant Min Zhu. However, Mei's heart belongs to Lin, a humble florist whose shop sits below her window, whom she has fallen in love with by watching his gentle, devoted care for his flowers each day and night.\n\nDesperate to escape her gilded cage and pursue true love, Mei approaches the gambling merchant Min Zhu with a dangerous proposition: she will wager her life savings against him in a game of Go. If she wins, he must match her payment and she can buy her own freedom. The game unfolds as a battle of wits and seduction, with Mei using her training to distract the merchant at a crucial moment, securing her victory through cunning rather than skill. Simultaneously, her servant delivers a heartfelt letter to Lin, confessing her secret love and admiration. As Mei claims her freedom and runs barefoot through the dirt streets to the florist shop, Lin reads her words by lantern light, and their eyes meet for the first time when she appears at his door\u2014wild-haired, breathless, and finally free.",

  "world_rules": "Set in historical East Asia with traditional social hierarchies where courtesans occupy a complex position between commodity and artist. The brothel system operates as both prison and finishing school, with elaborate codes of conduct and business. Games of chance and skill serve as legitimate means of settling debts and agreements. The world follows realistic historical constraints with no supernatural elements, emphasizing the rigid class structures that separate the wealthy from merchants, military officials from artisans, and the owned from the free.",
