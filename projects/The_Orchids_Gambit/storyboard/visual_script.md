## Scene 1: The Jewel in the Cage
[LOC_MEI_CHAMBER] - DAWN

[FRAME: wide, establishing] [KEY_FRAME] First light seeps through rice paper screens, painting [LOC_MEI_CHAMBER] in soft gold and shadow. The crimson silk bedding gleams like pooled blood against dark mahogany. Bronze oil lamps gutter low, nearly exhausted from the night's vigil. [CHAR_MEI]'s silhouette is visible at the latticed terrace doors, motionless, watching. The chamber is immaculate, oppressive in its luxury—every surface gleaming, every object placed with precision. Through the lattice, the distant corner of [LOC_FLOWER_SHOP] is visible below, already showing signs of life.

[FRAME: medium, [CHAR_MEI]] [CHAR_MEI] stands at the terrace threshold, her powder blue kimono loosely wrapped, morning informal. Her black hair is unbound, cascading past her waist like dark water. Her face, unpainted and vulnerable in the early light, wears an expression rarely seen—naked longing. Her fingers rest against the lattice frame, not gripping but touching, as if the wood connects her to the world beyond. Her amber-brown eyes are fixed on something below, soft with an emotion no client has ever witnessed.

[FRAME: pov, [CHAR_LIN] from above] Through [CHAR_MEI]'s eyes: [LOC_FLOWER_SHOP] awakens below. [CHAR_LIN] emerges into the frame, carrying a watering pot, his movements unhurried and gentle. Even from this distance, his lean figure in faded indigo is unmistakable. He bends to a pot of orchids, and his hands—though tiny from this height—move with visible tenderness. He hums. The sound drifts up, faint but clear in the morning stillness. A white orchid catches the first direct sunlight, and [CHAR_LIN] turns it slightly to receive the light more fully.

[FRAME: close-up, [CHAR_MEI]'s face] [CHAR_MEI]'s features in intimate proximity—porcelain skin luminous in the soft light, a single tear tracking down her cheek. Her lips part slightly, breathless, watching. The longing is almost painful to witness. This is not the calculated expression of a courtesan but the raw ache of a woman in love with someone she has never spoken to, may never speak to. Her lashes are wet. Her throat moves with a swallow of emotion.

[FRAME: extreme-close-up, hands and orchid] [KEY_FRAME] [CHAR_MEI]'s small, perfect hands lift a [PROP_ORCHID] from the terrace railing—white blooms trembling with the movement. Her fingers mimic what she has watched [CHAR_LIN] do a hundred times: checking soil moisture, adjusting the stem's angle toward light. Her touch is reverent, learned from observation, offered in devotion. A single petal drops, spiraling down toward the street below, toward [CHAR_LIN]'s world.

## Scene 2: The Final Suitors
[LOC_MAIN_HALL] - AFTERNOON

[FRAME: wide, establishing] [KEY_FRAME] The legendary main hall of Lu Xian drowns in amber silk-lantern light. Carved wooden beams soar overhead, red and gold. Two distinct parties occupy opposite sides of the grand space—military rigidity on the left, merchant opulence on the right. [CHAR_CHOU] presides from a raised platform, her dark robes stark against the surrounding color. Painted screens glow with suggested intimacies. Incense smoke hangs in visible layers. At the room's center, an empty cushion awaits its jewel.

[FRAME: medium, [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]] [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] reclines among brocade cushions, his burgundy silk robes spreading around him like a peacock's display. Gold thread dragons catch every flicker of lamplight. His fleshy face wears satisfaction like a mask, small shrewd eyes calculating as he surveys the competition across the room. His thick fingers stroke his pointed beard. Jade rings wink. A servant leans close to pour wine, and he waves them off without looking—his attention fixed on the empty cushion, already imagining his purchase seated there.

[FRAME: medium, General Zhao] Across the hall, General Zhao sits rigid in military formality—dark robes of rank, severe expression, back straight as his sword. His face is hard and angular, scarred above one eyebrow. Where [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] sprawls, Zhao contains. His hands rest on his knees, motionless. His eyes reveal nothing. Servants hover at a respectful distance, intimidated. This is a man who acquires things because he can, because strength takes what it wants. The empty cushion is simply another conquest.

[FRAME: tracking, [CHAR_MEI] entering] [KEY_FRAME] [CHAR_MEI] enters through beaded curtains, and the room's atmosphere shifts like a held breath released. She glides forward in her powder blue kimono, the white orchid embroidery catching light with each step. Her hair is elaborately arranged, the crimson [PROP_HAIR_RIBBON] a perfect accent. Her face is composed—training incarnate—showing nothing of the dawn's tears. She moves like music made visible, every gesture a performance. Both suitors straighten; even [CHAR_CHOU]'s eyes narrow with proprietary pride. Mei keeps her gaze demurely lowered, but we glimpse a flash of calculation as she assesses her buyers.

[FRAME: over-shoulder, [CHAR_MEI] toward [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]] From behind [CHAR_MEI]'s shoulder—her black hair and blue silk filling the foreground—we see [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] across the hall. His face betrays naked appetite, tongue touching his lip. His small eyes devour her. [CHAR_MEI]'s posture shows nothing, but her hidden hands—visible only to camera—clench briefly in her sleeves before smoothing to stillness. She has identified her mark. The merchant leans forward, already imagining victory. He doesn't know the game has already begun.

## Scene 3: The Wager Proposed
[LOC_MEI_CHAMBER] - EVENING

[FRAME: wide, establishing] [KEY_FRAME] Night has transformed [LOC_MEI_CHAMBER] into a theater of shadow and flame. Oil lamps burn brighter now, their amber glow creating pools of intimacy against dark corners. The crimson bedding gleams like an invitation. [CHAR_MEI] kneels at the low mahogany table, her posture perfect, her powder blue kimono arranged like petals. Across from her empty cushion, a place setting awaits. The [PROP_GO_BOARD] rests between them—black and white stones in their bowls like possibilities waiting to be played. The terrace doors are closed. This room is now a negotiation chamber.

[FRAME: medium, [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]] [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] enters through the sliding door, his bulk filling the frame, his burgundy robes rustling with each heavy step. His expression mingles anticipation with confusion—he expected a different kind of evening entertainment. His small eyes narrow at the Go board, then widen with interest. A betting man recognizes a wager. He settles onto the cushion across from [CHAR_MEI], the wood creaking slightly under his weight. His thick fingers drum once on his knee. He strokes his beard, waiting.

[FRAME: close-up, [PROP_SAVINGS_POUCH]] [CHAR_MEI]'s perfect hands withdraw the [PROP_SAVINGS_POUCH] from her sleeve—worn cotton so different from the surrounding silk. She places it on the table between them, the coins within clinking softly. Lamplight catches the humble fabric. This small pouch against [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s displayed wealth is almost absurd. Yet her hands are steady as she unties the cord, revealing years of careful saving—silver taels and copper cash accumulated coin by coin, dance by dance, smile by smile.

[FRAME: two-shot, the negotiation] [CHAR_MEI] and [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] face each other across the [PROP_GO_BOARD], the stakes visible between them. Her voice—unheard but clear in her expression—lays out the wager. Her chin lifts slightly as she speaks, one of her confident tells. His eyebrows rise, first with surprise, then with amused interest. The lamp flame flickers between them. He leans forward; she remains perfectly still. His thick finger points at her, then at the board, then at the pouch. His belly laugh shakes his frame—he thinks this game already won.

[FRAME: extreme-close-up, hands shaking] [KEY_FRAME] [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s thick jade-ringed hand engulfs [CHAR_MEI]'s delicate fingers as they shake on the wager. The contrast is stark: his pale fleshy palm against her slender porcelain fingers, his rings against her bare skin, merchant weight against courtesan grace. The deal is struck. In his grip, her hand disappears entirely, yet her fingers don't tremble. The lamp casts their joined hands in sharp shadow against the polished table. A game of Go. Her freedom. His amusement. Everything.

## Scene 4: The Letter's Journey
[LOC_FLOWER_SHOP] - EVENING (PARALLEL TIME)

[FRAME: wide, establishing] [KEY_FRAME] [LOC_FLOWER_SHOP] glows in the gathering dusk—a warm golden cube against the blue evening. Through the open front, flowers mass in silhouette, their colors muted but shapes alive. A single [PROP_LANTERN] burns at the back table where [CHAR_LIN]'s figure hunches over his evening meal. The street outside grows quiet; a few late pedestrians pass. The shop feels like a sanctuary, separate from the world's transactions, ruled by gentler laws. Orchids glow palely on their shelves like attending spirits.

[FRAME: medium, servant girl at door] A young servant girl from Lu Xian—plain robes, nervous hands—appears at the flower shop's threshold. She clutches a folded paper to her chest: the [PROP_LETTER]. Her eyes dart back toward the brothel, checking for watchers. [CHAR_LIN] looks up from his meal, surprised by a customer at this hour. The girl bows hastily, thrusts the letter toward him without meeting his eyes, and speaks rapidly—instructions, clearly memorized: read it at evening. Before he can respond, she retreats into the dusk, disappearing as if she was never there.

[FRAME: close-up, [CHAR_LIN]] [CHAR_LIN] holds the [PROP_LETTER]—folded rice paper, sealed with plain wax—as if it might dissolve. His lean face shows pure confusion, sun-touched brows drawing together, kind brown eyes searching the paper for explanation. His calloused thumb traces the seal. He lifts it to his nose unconsciously, catching the faint orchid scent. His lips part with a question that has no one to answer. The lantern light gilds his angular features, catching the gold flecks in his eyes. Instructions: read at evening. Evening is now.

[FRAME: extreme-close-up, seal breaking] [CHAR_LIN]'s work-roughened hands—soil still visible under the nails—carefully break the wax seal. The sound is small but definite in the quiet shop: a soft crack of wax, a whisper of paper unfolding. The rice paper opens like a flower blooming, revealing elegant brushwork within. His fingers are gentle, treating the letter as he would a delicate cutting, something precious that might be damaged by carelessness. The orchid scent rises more strongly from the opened paper.

[FRAME: medium, [CHAR_LIN] reading] [KEY_FRAME] [CHAR_LIN] draws the [PROP_LANTERN] closer, its warm light falling full on the [PROP_LETTER] and his wondering face. His lips move slightly as he reads, forming the words in silence. His expression transforms slowly—confusion to surprise, surprise to wonder, wonder to something that makes his eyes glisten. His breath catches. He reads: "I have seen you every day..." His hand rises unconsciously to the jade pendant at his throat—his mother's token, his one connection to love remembered. Outside, full dark has fallen. Inside, a new light dawns.

## Scene 5: The Game Begins
[LOC_MEI_CHAMBER] - EVENING (PARALLEL TIME)

[FRAME: wide, establishing] [KEY_FRAME] The [PROP_GO_BOARD] dominates the frame—nineteen by nineteen lines of fate mapped on aged mahogany. [CHAR_MEI] and [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] face each other across this battlefield, framed by bronze lamp glow against the chamber's deep shadows. The crimson bedding waits in soft focus behind them. The [PROP_SAVINGS_POUCH] sits beside the board like a witness. [CHAR_MEI]'s white stones have made first move. [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s thick fingers hover over his black stones, considering. The game has begun.

[FRAME: close-up, stones placed] A black stone clicks against the board—[CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s move, aggressive, claiming territory. Then a white stone answers—[CHAR_MEI]'s counter, elegant but reactive. Click. Click. Click. The rhythm builds. The camera tracks the pattern emerging on the board: black advancing, white defending. Each stone is a word in their silent argument. The merchant's stones march forward with confidence; the courtesan's stones scramble to contain. Already, the game's shape tells a story of outmatched skill.

[FRAME: medium, [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]] [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] radiates satisfaction. He leans back between moves, stroking his beard with jade-ringed fingers, small eyes crinkling with smug amusement. He knows Go; he has played this game in counting houses and tearooms across the empire. His bulk settles more comfortably into his cushion. He takes his time, savoring not just the victory forming on the board but the luxury of it—winning a beautiful woman through superior strategy. His belly moves with a silent chuckle. The outcome, to him, is already certain.

[FRAME: close-up, [CHAR_MEI]'s face] [CHAR_MEI]'s porcelain features remain composed, but her eyes tell the truth: she is losing. A slight tightening around her mouth, the smallest furrow between elegant brows. Her fingers hover over the bowl of white stones, hesitating—a tell she would normally never show. The lamp flame reflects in her amber-brown eyes as twin points of light. She knows the board, knows the math, knows what's coming. But beneath the surface desperation, something else moves: calculation. The game on the board is lost. The larger game is just beginning.

[FRAME: extreme-close-up, [CHAR_MEI]'s fingers on ribbon] [KEY_FRAME] [CHAR_MEI]'s hand rises from the white stones, not to play but to touch her hair—specifically, the crimson [PROP_HAIR_RIBBON] that binds her elaborate arrangement. Her fingers find the silk end, rest there for a heartbeat. Lamplight catches the deep red against her pale skin, the blue of her sleeve. A decision crystallizes behind her eyes. Her training, her weapon, her only remaining move. The ribbon waits to fall.

## Scene 6: The Gambit
[LOC_MEI_CHAMBER] - EVENING (CONTINUOUS)

[FRAME: medium, [CHAR_MEI] rising] [KEY_FRAME] [CHAR_MEI] rises from her cushion in one fluid motion—silk whispering, powder blue kimono falling in perfect lines. The movement is so graceful it seems rehearsed, yet carries genuine purpose. She reaches for the tea pot nearby, a legitimate excuse for proximity. [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] looks up from the board, surprised by her movement but pleased by the service. He doesn't see the subtle shift in her posture, the deliberate softening of her shoulders, the way her breath has changed.

[FRAME: tracking, [CHAR_MEI] moving behind] [CHAR_MEI] glides around the table, [PROP_TEA_CUP] in hand, her path taking her behind [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]. Each step is calculated: close enough to warm the air, far enough to build anticipation. Her hand rises to her hair as she moves—a gesture that seems unconscious, simply adjusting. Her fingers find the crimson [PROP_HAIR_RIBBON]. The camera follows her like a falling leaf, slow and inevitable. She arrives at his shoulder.

[FRAME: close-up, ribbon release] [KEY_FRAME] [CHAR_MEI]'s fingers pull the [PROP_HAIR_RIBBON], and everything changes. The crimson silk slides free in a rippling cascade. Her black hair—unbound, impossibly long—falls over her shoulder in a dark waterfall, cascading across [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s field of vision. Her orchid perfume, held close by the hair all evening, wafts across his face in a concentrated wave. The ribbon drifts down like a promise. Time seems to slow. His eyes widen.

[FRAME: over-shoulder from [CHAR_MEI], pouring tea] From behind [CHAR_MEI], we see over her bare shoulder—kimono slipped slightly, pale skin glowing—as she leans to pour tea into [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s cup. Her hair brushes his ear. Her warmth presses soft against him. Steam rises from the amber tea. His face is visible past her profile: flushed, lips parted, eyes unfocused. The Go board, the game, the wager—all have vanished from his mind. There is only her: scent, warmth, proximity, the whisper of silk and hair and skin. His thick fingers grip his knees.

[FRAME: extreme-close-up, [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s eyes] [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s small shrewd eyes have glazed over, pupils dilated, seeing something that isn't in the room. His mind has wandered—we know where, though we don't follow. The lamp flame flickers in his unfocused gaze. Sweat beads at his temple. His tongue touches his lip. He is somewhere else: imagining blue silk sliding from shoulders, crimson bedding receiving a pale body, pleasures purchased and possessed. The game board waits, forgotten. The moment stretches. [CHAR_MEI] has retreated to her seat, waiting. He reaches blindly for a stone.

## Scene 7: Victory and Freedom
[LOC_MEI_CHAMBER] / [LOC_FLOWER_SHOP] - EVENING (INTERCUT)

[FRAME: close-up, decisive move] [KEY_FRAME] CLICK. The sound of a stone placed—white stone, [CHAR_MEI
