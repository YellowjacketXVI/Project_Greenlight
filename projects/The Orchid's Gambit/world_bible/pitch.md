## Synopsis
In feudal China, in a great city, right outside the main palace, is a lively merchant district bringing in luxurious trade and products that keep the city thriving. At the heart of it is the Lixuan Brothel, where it is said the most beautiful of courtesans are raised and available. The most noteworthy is the young, beautiful Mei, who is highly sought after, trained in the arts of entertainment for her clients, yet virtuous and innocent, awaiting a significant offer. She yearns for a life beyond her current circumstances, to be loved for who she is, not just her appearance, and to define love on her own terms. She observes the florist across the street, tending to his orchids with meticulous care and dedication, and sees in this a reflection of the true love she desires. From afar, she watches him every morning, fantasizing about a life where she is cherished with such devotion. Instead, she finds herself in a reality where she feels her worth is solely tied to entertaining and pleasing her suitors. She devises a plan to stake her future on a game with a client: she offers herself to him at a discounted price for marriage and loyal service as a wife if he wins at a game of Go, or complete freedom if she wins. She approaches the military general Zhoa  with the deal, he is to buy her for cheap as his wife if he wins at a game of go, if she wins then he is to buy her and let her free. The man agrees. At the arranged time she meets him framed by the arched balcony door of her luxurious room she sits and waits to play him in a game of go. Finely dressed in her kimono both of them intensely strategize, knowing his focus would be hard to overcome she offers a plan of distraction. By using her subtle beauty and provocative ability she distracts the man into fantasizing about her. She gives him tea leaning over his shoulder and refilling her cup allowing her hair to waft over his shoulder, her scent filling his sense, her warm present on his back, and bosom pressed to the side of his head. She sits down to continue playing. The man's attention drifts to a vivid daydream of him approaching her from behind and stripping her of her kimono to make love to her. Then he snaps out of it to a play that decides the game where he lost. The courtesan with her win leave the room where the man sits starring at the board stunned in loss.
