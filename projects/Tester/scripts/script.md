*A prized courtesan on the eve of being sold to the highest bidder risks everything on a game of Go to win her freedom and pursue the humble florist she has silently loved from afar.*


## Scene 1:
A delicate wooden balcony overlooking the corner where two streets meet, latticed screens filtering the morning light

The first light of morning crept across the rooftops of the pleasure district, painting [LOC_LU_XIAN_BROTHEL] in shades of rose and amber. [CHAR_MEI] stood at the edge of her patio, her silk sleeping robe gathered loosely at her throat, watching the street below come alive.

She had learned to wake before the household stirred. These stolen moments belonged to her alone—the only currency [CHAR_MADAME_CHOU] could not count or trade.

Below, at the corner where [LOC_PRESSED_DIRT_ROAD] curved toward the market quarter, [CHAR_LIN] emerged from [LOC_FLORIST_SHOP] carrying a [PROP_WATERING_VESSEL] glazed the color of celadon. [CHAR_MEI] pressed her fingertips against the lattice screen, feeling the wood bite gently into her skin.

He moved among his flowers the way she had been taught to move among men—with intention, with awareness of each gesture's weight. But where her grace served transaction, his served only beauty. He knelt before a cluster of white peonies, tilting the vessel with such tenderness that [CHAR_MEI] felt her breath catch.

She had never heard his voice. Did not know if he laughed easily or spoke in careful measures. Yet she knew the precise angle of his shoulders when he discovered a bloom had opened overnight. She knew the way he hummed—she could not hear the melody, but she had memorized the rhythm of his body swaying.

This was devotion, she understood. Not the practiced adoration she would soon perform for whichever man purchased her, but something true. Something that asked nothing in return.

[CHAR_LIN] looked up suddenly, and [CHAR_MEI] stepped back into shadow, her heart hammering against her ribs like a caged bird. He was only checking the sky for rain. He had not seen her.

He never saw her.

She remained hidden until he returned inside, then touched the lattice once more where her fingers had pressed, as if she could hold the moment there forever.

## Scene 2:
The main receiving hall, silk screens depicting mountain landscapes, lacquered furniture arranged for intimate conversation

The receiving hall of [LOC_LU_XIAN_BROTHEL_DIR_E] smelled of sandalwood and ambition. [CHAR_MEI] knelt on embroidered cushions, her morning robe exchanged for formal silks the color of spring plums, while [CHAR_MADAME_CHOU] circled her like a merchant appraising jade.

"Tonight, you will meet them both." [CHAR_MADAME_CHOU]'s voice carried the practiced warmth of a woman who had learned to make commerce sound like kindness. She adjusted the [PROP_JADE_HAIRPIN] nestled in [CHAR_MEI]'s elaborate coiffure. "General Zhoa arrives at the hour of the rooster. The merchant Min Zhu follows at the hour of the dog."

"Yes, Madame."

"You will pour tea. You will recite the poetry we practiced. You will let them see what they are purchasing." [CHAR_MADAME_CHOU] paused, her fingers lingering on [CHAR_MEI]'s shoulder. "You have been my finest work, child. Do not disappoint me."

[CHAR_MEI] kept her eyes lowered, her expression serene as still water. Beneath that surface, something else moved—something with teeth.

"I am grateful for all you have given me, Madame."

The older woman's hand withdrew. "Gratitude." She laughed softly, though her eyes held something almost like sorrow. "Gratitude is what we teach them to feel. You, I hoped, might understand better."

[CHAR_MEI] raised her gaze then, meeting [CHAR_MADAME_CHOU]'s painted face. "I understand perfectly, Madame. You taught me everything I know."

The words hung between them—acknowledgment and accusation braided together. [CHAR_MADAME_CHOU] turned away first, moving toward the door.

"Prepare yourself well, Mei. Your entire future will be decided before dawn."

Alone, [CHAR_MEI] touched the jade pin in her hair and thought of white peonies bending toward gentle hands.

## Scene 3:
A modest wooden structure with open shutters displaying cascading arrangements of chrysanthemums, orchids, and peonies in ceramic vessels

[CHAR_LIN] worked with his back to the street, fingers moving through soil dark as ink. The morning had brought three customers—a widow seeking white lilies, a merchant's wife demanding something ostentatious, and a child who had simply wanted to smell the jasmine. He had given the child a sprig for free.

The [PROP_WATERING_VESSEL] sat empty now beside a row of orchids he had been nursing through a stubborn refusal to bloom. He spoke to them sometimes, when the street fell quiet.

"You are being difficult." His voice was low, unhurried. "I have given you everything. Good soil. Morning light. Still you hold yourself closed."

He touched one reluctant bud with his thumb, feeling its potential coiled tight within.

The pleasure district surrounded [LOC_FLORIST_SHOP_DIR_N] like silk around a stone. Painted women passed his door; wealthy men came seeking arrangements for their favorites. [CHAR_LIN] sold to them all without judgment, though he sometimes wondered what it meant to give flowers to someone who was herself treated as decoration.

He straightened, pressing one hand to the small of his back, and let his gaze drift upward toward [LOC_LU_XIAN_BROTHEL]. The latticed patio caught the light, its screens casting geometric shadows. He had noticed movement there before—a figure retreating, a flutter of silk. Someone who rose early, as he did.

He did not know her name. Did not know if she was courtesan or servant.

But he had begun arranging his finest peonies where she might see them, if she looked.

[CHAR_LIN] turned back to his orchids, unaware that he was smiling.

## Scene 4:
A private dressing chamber with bronze mirrors and silk screens, cosmetics arranged on lacquered trays

The afternoon light slanted through [LOC_LU_XIAN_BROTHEL_DIR_W]'s high windows as [CHAR_MEI] sat before her bronze mirror, though she did not see her reflection. Her hands trembled over rice paper, brush poised but unmoving.

[CHAR_SERVANT_GIRL_01] knelt nearby, pretending to sort cosmetics. She was perhaps fourteen, with quick eyes that had learned to see everything while appearing to notice nothing.

"You must deliver this to the florist on the corner." [CHAR_MEI]'s voice emerged barely above a whisper. "Tell him to read it only at evening. Can you do this?"

The girl's hands stilled over the rouge pots. "The one with the peonies?"

"Yes." [CHAR_MEI] finally touched brush to paper, her calligraphy precise despite her shaking. She wrote of flowers tended with devotion. Of mornings watched from above. Of a woman who had never known gentleness that asked nothing in return.

She did not write her name.

"Miss Mei." The servant girl moved closer, her voice dropping. "If Madame discovers—"

"She will not." [CHAR_MEI] folded the paper with deliberate care, sealing it with a ribbon the color of peach blossoms. "Unless you tell her."

Their eyes met. In the girl's face, [CHAR_MEI] recognized something familiar—the careful blankness of someone who had also learned to hide her true self beneath layers of obedience.

"I was sold here at nine years old," the servant girl said quietly. "I have never seen anyone try to leave."

[CHAR_MEI] pressed the note into her hands. "Then watch carefully."

The girl tucked the letter into her sleeve and slipped toward the door, pausing at the threshold.

"Evening," she repeated. "I will remember."

## Scene 5:
The modest wooden structure at dusk, lantern light beginning to glow through paper screens, flowers closing their petals for the night

The evening brought its familiar rituals to [LOC_FLORIST_SHOP_DIR_N]. [CHAR_LIN] moved through them without thought—closing shutters, trimming stems that had wilted in the day's heat, sweeping petals from the worn wooden floor. The [PROP_WATERING_VESSEL] stood ready for morning, filled and waiting.

He had nearly forgotten the girl who had pressed something into his hands that afternoon. A child from the pleasure district, eyes downcast, voice barely audible. "For evening," she had said, then vanished before he could question her.

Now, with his work complete and lantern light pooling gold across his workbench, [CHAR_LIN] unfolded the paper.

The calligraphy was exquisite. Each stroke deliberate, learned. He read slowly, as he did everything, letting the words settle like seeds into soil.

Someone watched him. Had watched him for what seemed like years of mornings. Someone who saw poetry in how he touched his flowers, who understood that gentleness was not weakness but intention.

[CHAR_LIN] looked up toward [LOC_LU_XIAN_BROTHEL], toward the latticed patio now dark against the purple sky. The figure he had glimpsed—the flutter of silk at dawn—

His heart moved strangely in his chest.

He read the letter again. Then once more. The writer spoke of wanting to be tended, to be seen, to grow toward something true.

[CHAR_LIN] touched the stubborn orchid beside him, the one that refused to bloom.

"Perhaps," he murmured to it, "we have both been waiting."

He folded the letter carefully and pressed it against his chest, where it rested warm as a living thing.

## Scene 6:
The private receiving chamber, intimate and perfumed, with silk cushions arranged around a low mahogany table bearing a wooden go board

The receiving chamber had been prepared with military precision—[CHAR_MADAME_CHOU]'s instructions followed to the letter. Incense curled from bronze vessels. The [PROP_GO_BOARD] waited on its mahogany table, black and white stones arranged in their ceramic bowls like opposing armies.

[CHAR_GENERAL_ZHOA] entered as he would a conquered city—surveying, assessing, already claiming ownership with his eyes.

"So this is the jewel of Lu Xian." His voice carried the authority of a man accustomed to obedience. He wore his formal robes like armor, each fold precise, his graying beard trimmed to a point sharp as his gaze.

[CHAR_MEI] rose and bowed, her movements liquid with practiced grace. "General Zhoa honors this humble house with his presence."

He circled her once, twice, the way she had seen merchants examine horses at market. She kept her eyes lowered, her breathing steady, though her skin crawled beneath his scrutiny.

"They taught you well." He settled onto the cushions across from her, gesturing at the go board. "You play?"

"Poorly, I confess. But I would be honored to learn from the General's expertise."

A smile carved itself across his weathered face. "False modesty. I have heard you defeat men twice your age." He placed a black stone with deliberate force. "I appreciate honesty in my possessions."

The word landed like a slap. [CHAR_MEI] placed her white stone with trembling fingers she prayed he would mistake for nervousness rather than fury.

"I am not yet possessed, General."

His eyes sharpened with interest rather than offense. "Spirit. Good. I tire of women who break too easily." He captured three of her stones in a single move. "But understand this—I have never lost a battle. Not on the field. Not in politics." His gaze held hers. "Not in matters of acquisition."

[CHAR_MEI] poured his tea with hands now steady, her mind racing behind her serene mask. Somewhere across the district, a florist held her letter against his heart. Somewhere, possibility still breathed.

She smiled and let [CHAR_GENERAL_ZHOA] believe he had already won.

## Scene 7:
The private receiving chamber, now reset with fresh incense and new tea, the go board cleared of the General's conquest

[CHAR_MIN_ZHU] arrived without announcement, slipping into the receiving chamber like silk through fingers. Where [CHAR_GENERAL_ZHOA] had conquered, this man collected—his eyes cataloguing every detail with the precision of an accountant tallying profits.

"The famous Mei." His voice poured smooth as aged wine. "I confess, I expected disappointment. Beauty so praised rarely survives scrutiny." He settled onto the cushions with practiced ease, his merchant's robes whispering wealth. "Yet here you are, exceeding even the wildest poetry."

[CHAR_MEI] poured tea, noting how his gaze followed her hands rather than her body. A man who appreciated craft. Useful.

"Master Min Zhu flatters me."

"I never flatter. Flattery implies exaggeration." He accepted the cup, inhaling its fragrance before drinking. "I simply recognize value. It is my particular gift."

She gestured toward the [PROP_GO_BOARD]. "Would you care to play?"

His laugh surprised her—genuine, delighted. "Ah, the General's game. He told you of his prowess, I assume? His unbroken victories?" [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] waved dismissively. "Soldiers understand only direct assault. They miss the subtler moves."

"And merchants understand subtlety?"

"Merchants understand that everything has a price—and that the cleverest transactions leave both parties believing they've won." His eyes glittered. "I am told you have savings, little jewel. Coins earned from dancing, from clever conversation. What does a caged bird save for, I wonder?"

[CHAR_MEI]'s heart stuttered, but her face remained porcelain-still.

"Perhaps," she said carefully, "she saves for a wager worth making."

[CHAR_MIN_ZHU] leaned forward, hunger sharpening his pleasant features. "Now that," he murmured, "is the most interesting thing anyone has said to me in years."

## Scene 8:
The delicate wooden balcony now silvered by moonlight, latticed screens casting intricate shadows across the floor

[CHAR_MEI] stood at [LOC_MEI_BEDROOM_PATIO_DIR_S] where she had stood countless mornings, though now the street below lay silver-dark and silent. Her formal silks had been exchanged for sleeping robes, but sleep would not come. Not tonight.

The General wanted a trophy. The merchant wanted a treasure. Neither wanted her.

She pressed her forehead against the cool lattice, feeling the wood's familiar pattern bite into her skin. Tomorrow she would approach [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] with her proposition. Her savings—years of coins pressed into her palm by men who thought they were buying moments of her attention—against her freedom. A game of go. A gambler's wager.

Her hands trembled. She was good, but was she good enough?

Below, a single lantern still burned in [LOC_FLORIST_SHOP]. [CHAR_MEI]'s breath caught. [CHAR_LIN] worked late, perhaps preparing arrangements for morning customers. Perhaps reading her letter again.

Perhaps thinking of her.

The thought steadied something within her chest. She had spent her life learning to read men—their desires, their weaknesses, the spaces between their words where truth hid. [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] craved the thrill of the wager more than he craved her body. She had seen it in his eyes when she mentioned her savings.

She could use that hunger.

The lantern below flickered, and [CHAR_MEI] imagined [CHAR_LIN]'s gentle hands folding her letter, pressing it close. She had never known such hands. But she would. She would tend her own garden, grow toward her own sun.

Or she would lose everything trying.

## Scene 9:
A secluded garden courtyard within the brothel, stone benches arranged beneath a gnarled plum tree, morning mist clinging to ornamental grasses

The morning mist clung to [LOC_LU_XIAN_BROTHEL_DIR_E]'s hidden courtyard like a secret refusing to disperse. [CHAR_MEI] had sent word through careful channels—a servant who owed her kindness, a guard who looked the other way. [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] arrived as dawn pearled the sky, his merchant's curiosity sharper than any blade.

"You summoned me before the household wakes." He settled onto the stone bench, amusement playing across his features. "Either you wish to compromise my reputation or propose something deliciously improper."

[CHAR_MEI] remained standing, her hands folded with deliberate calm. "I wish to offer you a wager, Master Min."

His eyebrows rose. "Continue."

"My savings. Every coin I have earned in seven years of service." She let the weight of that settle between them. "Against my purchase price—at discount. If I defeat you at go, you match my payment and I buy my own freedom."

Silence stretched taut as silk thread.

"And if you lose?"

"You acquire me for a fraction of what [CHAR_GENERAL_ZHOA] would pay. A bargain even you cannot resist."

[CHAR_MIN_ZHU] laughed—that genuine, delighted sound she had catalogued the night before. "You understand me better than men I've known for decades." He stood, circling her as the General had, but his assessment carried different weight. "You cannot win, little jewel. I have played go since before you were born."

"Then you risk nothing."

The words hung crystalline in the morning air. [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s eyes narrowed with something approaching respect.

"Tonight," he said finally. "Your chamber. We play until one of us owns your future."

[CHAR_MEI] bowed, hiding the wild thunder of her heart.

## Scene 10:
The private chamber transformed into an arena of fate, moonlight streaming through latticed screens onto the mahogany table where the go board waits

The [PROP_GO_BOARD] between them had become a battlefield of black and white stones, territory claimed and contested across hours of silence. [CHAR_MEI] studied the pattern with growing dread. [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] had cornered her eastern territory, his stones advancing with the inevitability of tide.

She was losing.

"You play admirably." His voice carried genuine appreciation. "But you see it now, don't you? Three moves. Perhaps four."

[CHAR_MEI]'s fingers hovered over her remaining white stones. Everything she had saved. Every coin pressed into her palm. Every morning watching [CHAR_LIN] tend his flowers. All of it balanced on this moment.

She rose gracefully, moving toward the tea service. "You must be parched, Master Min."

"Conceding already?"

"Merely observing hospitality." She lifted the pot, then paused, her free hand rising to the [PROP_JADE_HAIRPIN] securing her elaborate coiffure. One gentle pull, and silk-black hair cascaded over her shoulder, releasing the jasmine perfume she had chosen with such care.

She felt him still behind her.

[CHAR_MEI] approached slowly, leaning to pour his tea. Her hair brushed his cheek. Her body curved close enough that he could feel her warmth through silk, her breast grazing his ear as she extended the cup.

When she returned to her cushion, [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s hand trembled slightly as he placed his next stone.

He placed it wrong.

Three moves later, [CHAR_MEI] captured his formation. The game shifted like sand beneath a wave.

"Well played," he breathed, something like admiration burning in his eyes. "You used everything I thought I was purchasing."

"I used what I was taught." She placed her final stone. "To survive."

## Scene 11:
The private chamber now illuminated by guttering candles, the go board bearing witness to completed battle, moonlight washing through latticed screens

The final stone clicked into place with a sound like a door unlocking. [CHAR_MEI] stared at the [PROP_GO_BOARD], at the white formation that had swallowed [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s advantage whole, and could not quite believe what her hands had wrought.

"It is done." Her voice emerged strange to her own ears—thin, uncertain.

[CHAR_MIN_ZHU] leaned back on his cushion, studying the board with the expression of a man examining a particularly fine piece of calligraphy. The tremor she had induced in him had faded, replaced by something she had not anticipated: genuine pleasure.

"In forty years of commerce, I have been cheated, flattered, threatened, and bribed." He traced the edge of the board with one finger. "But I have never been so elegantly defeated. You used my own desire as a weapon against me."

"You are not angry?"

His laugh startled her—warm, almost paternal. "Angry? Little jewel, I have purchased countless beautiful things. Jade. Silk. Women." He met her eyes. "But I have never purchased a memory like this. The night I was beaten by a courtesan who turned her chains into a key."

[CHAR_MEI]'s hands would not stop shaking. She pressed them flat against her thighs, willing stillness.

[CHAR_MIN_ZHU] reached into his robes and withdrew a [PROP_DOCUMENT_SCROLL] and a small leather purse heavy with coin. He set both on the mahogany table beside the conquered stones.

"Your savings, matched as promised. And this—" he tapped the scroll, "—is the document of sale, signed by Madame Chou this morning. I had intended to complete the purchase after our game." A wry smile. "The terms are now yours to dictate."

[CHAR_MEI] reached for the scroll with fingers that felt borrowed from someone else. The paper was smooth, official, bearing [CHAR_MADAME_CHOU]'s seal in red wax. She could tear it. Burn it. Write her own name where a master's should go.

"Why?" The question escaped before she could cage it. "You could claim I cheated. No one would believe a courtesan over a merchant."

[CHAR_MIN_ZHU] rose, adjusting his robes with the dignity of a man who had lost nothing that mattered. "Because I am a collector, Mei. And some things are more valuable free than caged." He paused at the door, silhouetted against the corridor's dim light. "Besides—I suspect you will make something extraordinary of this life. And I will always know I had a hand in it."

The door closed behind him.

[CHAR_MEI] sat alone in the guttering candlelight, the scroll pressed against her chest where her heart beat wild and strange and free. Through the latticed screens, she could see the first gray suggestion of dawn touching the sky above [LOC_FLORIST_SHOP].

She wept then—silently, completely—tears falling onto paper that bore the weight of her entire future.

## Scene 12:
The modest wooden structure at dawn, shutters thrown wide to receive the morning light, peonies arranged in ceramic vessels catching the first golden rays

The [PROP_DOCUMENT_SCROLL] felt impossibly light in [CHAR_MEI]'s sleeve as she descended the stairs of [LOC_LU_XIAN_BROTHEL] for the last time. She had changed from her formal silks into simpler robes—cotton the color of morning clouds, her hair unadorned and falling loose past her shoulders. [CHAR_MADAME_CHOU] had watched her go in silence, something unreadable moving behind her painted eyes.

[CHAR_MEI] stepped onto [LOC_PRESSED_DIRT_ROAD] and felt the earth solid beneath her feet. No lattice between her and the world. No screens filtering the light.

[LOC_FLORIST_SHOP_DIR_W] stood exactly where it had always stood, its shutters thrown wide to catch the dawn. The peonies blazed white and pink in their ceramic vessels, and among them moved [CHAR_LIN], his back to the street, the [PROP_WATERING_VESSEL] tilting gentle streams over thirsty roots.

She had watched him a thousand mornings. She knew the angle of his shoulders, the rhythm of his movements, the way he hummed without sound. But she had never stood close enough to see the gray threading his temples, the calluses mapping his palms, the small scar above his left eyebrow.

"Your peonies." Her voice emerged strange—too loud, too present. "They are the most beautiful in the district."

[CHAR_LIN] turned, and [CHAR_MEI] watched recognition bloom across his features like one of his flowers opening to sun. He held her letter's ribbon in his hand—peach-colored, creased from handling.

"You wrote this." Not a question. His voice was lower than she had imagined, roughened by years of early mornings. "You watch from above."

"Every day." She stepped closer, her heart hammering against her ribs. "I have watched you tend your garden with such care. Such patience." The words she had rehearsed scattered like petals in wind. "I wanted—I hoped—"

He set down the [PROP_WATERING_VESSEL] with infinite gentleness. "I arranged my finest blooms where you might see them. I did not know your name, but I knew you rose with the dawn." A hesitant smile curved his weathered face. "I thought perhaps you were lonely too."

[CHAR_MEI] felt tears threatening and did not hide them. She had spent years mastering her expressions, controlling every flicker of emotion. Now she let her face show everything—the fear, the hope, the desperate wanting.

"I am free." She touched the scroll through her sleeve. "I bought my freedom last night. And I came here because—" She faltered, suddenly terrified. What if devotion observed was not devotion returned? What if she had built a fantasy from glimpses and yearning?

[CHAR_LIN] reached toward her, then stopped, his hand hovering in the space between them. "I know only how to tend growing things," he said quietly. "I know soil and water and patience. I know how to coax beauty from reluctant buds." His eyes held hers. "Will you teach me how to tend a heart?"

[CHAR_MEI] closed the distance between them and placed her hand in his. His palm was warm, rough with honest work, gentle as she had always imagined.

"We will learn together," she whispered.

## Scene 13:
The modest wooden structure transformed by afternoon light, ceramic vessels overflowing with white peonies, a small table set with tea for two beneath the open shutters

The afternoon sun slanted through [LOC_FLORIST_SHOP_DIR_W]'s open shutters, painting gold across the worn wooden floor where [CHAR_MEI] knelt beside a row of orchids. Her hands—once trained only for pouring tea and arranging silk—now pressed gently into dark soil, learning its secrets.

"Not so deep." [CHAR_LIN] crouched beside her, his voice carrying the patience she had observed from her distant patio for so many years. "Orchid roots need air to breathe. Like this."

His calloused fingers guided hers, adjusting the depth of the cutting she was planting. [CHAR_MEI] felt the warmth of his palm against her wrist and marveled at how natural it had become—this touching without transaction, this closeness without cost.

"I am a poor student," she said, though she was smiling.

"You are learning." He sat back on his heels, studying her work with genuine approval. "These will bloom by winter. You planted them. They will be yours."

The word settled into her chest like sunlight into soil. Hers. The [PROP_DOCUMENT_SCROLL] hung framed now above the shop's entrance—not hidden in shame but displayed in triumph. [CHAR_MADAME_CHOU] had sent no word since [CHAR_MEI]'s departure. [CHAR_GENERAL_ZHOA] had purchased another girl. [CHAR_MIN_ZHU], she had heard, told the story of their game at every banquet, embellishing her victory until she had become legend.

Let them talk. Let them remember.

[CHAR_MEI] wiped soil from her fingers and reached for the [PROP_WATERING_VESSEL], now as familiar to her hands as any instrument of seduction had once been. She tended the stubborn orchid [CHAR_LIN] had shown her that first morning—the one that had finally, impossibly, bloomed.

"It opened for you," he had said, wonder softening his weathered features. "It waited."

Now she poured water over its roots while [CHAR_LIN] prepared tea at the small table they shared for meals. Through the open shutters, she could see [LOC_LU_XIAN_BROTHEL]'s latticed patio catching the fading light. Another girl stood there now, perhaps watching, perhaps dreaming.

[CHAR_MEI] hoped she would find her own game to play.

"Tea is ready," [CHAR_LIN] called.

She rose, brushing soil from her simple cotton robes, and crossed to where he waited. No performance. No calculation. Just two people learning to grow toward each other, patient as flowers reaching for the sun.
