  "visual_script": "## Scene 1: The Jewel in the Cage\n[LOC_MEI_CHAMBER] - DAWN\n\n[FRAME: wide, establishing] [KEY_FRAME] First light seeps through rice paper screens, painting [LOC_MEI_CHAMBER] in soft gold and shadow. The crimson silk bedding gleams like pooled blood against dark mahogany. Bronze oil lamps gutter low, nearly exhausted from the night's vigil. [CHAR_MEI]'s silhouette is visible at the latticed terrace doors, motionless, watching. The chamber is immaculate, oppressive in its luxury—every surface gleaming, every object placed with precision. Through the lattice, the distant corner of [LOC_FLOWER_SHOP] is visible below, already showing signs of life.\n\n[FRAME: medium, [CHAR_MEI]] [CHAR_MEI] stands at the terrace threshold, her powder blue kimono loosely wrapped, morning informal. Her black hair is unbound, cascading past her waist like dark water. Her face, unpainted and vulnerable in the early light, wears an expression rarely seen—naked longing. Her fingers rest against the lattice frame, not gripping but touching, as if the wood connects her to the world beyond. Her amber-brown eyes are fixed on something below, soft with an emotion no client has ever witnessed.\n\n[FRAME: pov, [CHAR_LIN] from above] Through [CHAR_MEI]'s eyes: [LOC_FLOWER_SHOP] awakens below. [CHAR_LIN] emerges into the frame, carrying a watering pot, his movements unhurried and gentle. Even from this distance, his lean figure in faded indigo is unmistakable. He bends to a pot of orchids, and his hands—though tiny from this height—move with visible tenderness. He hums. The sound drifts up, faint but clear in the morning stillness. A white orchid catches the first direct sunlight, and [CHAR_LIN] turns it slightly to receive the light more fully.\n\n[FRAME: close-up, [CHAR_MEI]'s face] [CHAR_MEI]'s features in intimate proximity—porcelain skin luminous in the soft light, a single tear tracking down her cheek. Her lips part slightly, breathless, watching. The longing is almost painful to witness. This is not the calculated expression of a courtesan but the raw ache of a woman in love with someone she has never spoken to, may never speak to. Her lashes are wet. Her throat moves with a swallow of emotion.\n\n[FRAME: extreme-close-up, hands and orchid] [KEY_FRAME] [CHAR_MEI]'s small, perfect hands lift a [PROP_ORCHID] from the terrace railing—white blooms trembling with the movement. Her fingers mimic what she has watched [CHAR_LIN] do a hundred times: checking soil moisture, adjusting the stem's angle toward light. Her touch is reverent, learned from observation, offered in devotion. A single petal drops, spiraling down toward the street below, toward [CHAR_LIN]'s world.\n\n---\n\n## Scene 2: The Final Suitors\n[LOC_MAIN_HALL] - AFTERNOON\n\n[FRAME: wide, establishing] [KEY_FRAME] The legendary main hall of Lu Xian drowns in amber silk-lantern light. Carved wooden beams soar overhead, red and gold. Two distinct parties occupy opposite sides of the grand space—military rigidity on the left, merchant opulence on the right. [CHAR_CHOU] presides from a raised platform, her dark robes stark against the surrounding color. Painted screens glow with suggested intimacies. Incense smoke hangs in visible layers. At the room's center, an empty cushion awaits its jewel.\n\n[FRAME: medium, [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]] [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] reclines among brocade cushions, his burgundy silk robes spreading around him like a peacock's display. Gold thread dragons catch every flicker of lamplight. His fleshy face wears satisfaction like a mask, small shrewd eyes calculating as he surveys the competition across the room. His thick fingers stroke his pointed beard. Jade rings wink. A servant leans close to pour wine, and he waves them off without looking—his attention fixed on the empty cushion, already imagining his purchase seated there.\n\n[FRAME: medium, General Zhao] Across the hall, General Zhao sits rigid in military formality—dark robes of rank, severe expression, back straight as his sword. His face is hard and angular, scarred above one eyebrow. Where [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] sprawls, Zhao contains. His hands rest on his knees, motionless. His eyes reveal nothing. Servants hover at a respectful distance, intimidated. This is a man who acquires things because he can, because strength takes what it wants. The empty cushion is simply another conquest.\n\n[FRAME: tracking, [CHAR_MEI] entering] [KEY_FRAME] [CHAR_MEI] enters through beaded curtains, and the room's atmosphere shifts like a held breath released. She glides forward in her powder blue kimono, the white orchid embroidery catching light with each step. Her hair is elaborately arranged, the crimson [PROP_HAIR_RIBBON] a perfect accent. Her face is composed—training incarnate—showing nothing of the dawn's tears. She moves like music made visible, every gesture a performance. Both suitors straighten; even [CHAR_CHOU]'s eyes narrow with proprietary pride. Mei keeps her gaze demurely lowered, but we glimpse a flash of calculation as she assesses her buyers.\n\n[FRAME: over-shoulder, [CHAR_MEI] toward [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]] From behind [CHAR_MEI]'s shoulder—her black hair and blue silk filling the foreground—we see [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] across the hall. His face betrays naked appetite, tongue touching his lip. His small eyes devour her. [CHAR_MEI]'s posture shows nothing, but her hidden hands—visible only to camera—clench briefly in her sleeves before smoothing to stillness. She has identified her mark. The merchant leans forward, already imagining victory. He doesn't know the game has already begun.\n\n---\n\n## Scene 3: The Wager Proposed\n[LOC_MEI_CHAMBER] - EVENING\n\n[FRAME: wide, establishing] [KEY_FRAME] Night has transformed [LOC_MEI_CHAMBER] into a theater of shadow and flame. Oil lamps burn brighter now, their amber glow creating pools of intimacy against dark corners. The crimson bedding gleams like an invitation. [CHAR_MEI] kneels at the low mahogany table, her posture perfect, her powder blue kimono arranged like petals. Across from her empty cushion, a place setting awaits. The [PROP_GO_BOARD] rests between them—black and white stones in their bowls like possibilities waiting to be played. The terrace doors are closed. This room is now a negotiation chamber.\n\n[FRAME: medium, [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]] [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] enters through the sliding door, his bulk filling the frame, his burgundy robes rustling with each heavy step. His expression mingles anticipation with confusion—he expected a different kind of evening entertainment. His small eyes narrow at the Go board, then widen with interest. A betting man recognizes a wager. He settles onto the cushion across from [CHAR_MEI], the wood creaking slightly under his weight. His thick fingers drum once on his knee. He strokes his beard, waiting.\n\n[FRAME: close-up, [PROP_SAVINGS_POUCH]] [CHAR_MEI]'s perfect hands withdraw the [PROP_SAVINGS_POUCH] from her sleeve—worn cotton so different from the surrounding silk. She places it on the table between them, the coins within clinking softly. Lamplight catches the humble fabric. This small pouch against [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s displayed wealth is almost absurd. Yet her hands are steady as she unties the cord, revealing years of careful saving—silver taels and copper cash accumulated coin by coin, dance by dance, smile by smile.\n\n[FRAME: two-shot, the negotiation] [CHAR_MEI] and [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] face each other across the [PROP_GO_BOARD], the stakes visible between them. Her voice—unheard but clear in her expression—lays out the wager. Her chin lifts slightly as she speaks, one of her confident tells. His eyebrows rise, first with surprise, then with amused interest. The lamp flame flickers between them. He leans forward; she remains perfectly still. His thick finger points at her, then at the board, then at the pouch. His belly laugh shakes his frame—he thinks this game already won.\n\n[FRAME: extreme-close-up, hands shaking] [KEY_FRAME] [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s thick jade-ringed hand engulfs [CHAR_MEI]'s delicate fingers as they shake on the wager. The contrast is stark: his pale fleshy palm against her slender porcelain fingers, his rings against her bare skin, merchant weight against courtesan grace. The deal is struck. In his grip, her hand disappears entirely, yet her fingers don't tremble. The lamp casts their joined hands in sharp shadow against the polished table. A game of Go. Her freedom. His amusement. Everything.\n\n---\n\n## Scene 4: The Letter's Journey\n[LOC_FLOWER_SHOP] - EVENING (PARALLEL TIME)\n\n[FRAME: wide, establishing] [KEY_FRAME] [LOC_FLOWER_SHOP] glows in the gathering dusk—a warm golden cube against the blue evening. Through the open front, flowers mass in silhouette, their colors muted but shapes alive. A single [PROP_LANTERN] burns at the back table where [CHAR_LIN]'s figure hunches over his evening meal. The street outside grows quiet; a few late pedestrians pass. The shop feels like a sanctuary, separate from the world's transactions, ruled by gentler laws. Orchids glow palely on their shelves like attending spirits.\n\n[FRAME: medium, servant girl at door] A young servant girl from Lu Xian—plain robes, nervous hands—appears at the flower shop's threshold. She clutches a folded paper to her chest: the [PROP_LETTER]. Her eyes dart back toward the brothel, checking for watchers. [CHAR_LIN] looks up from his meal, surprised by a customer at this hour. The girl bows hastily, thrusts the letter toward him without meeting his eyes, and speaks rapidly—instructions, clearly memorized: read it at evening. Before he can respond, she retreats into the dusk, disappearing as if she was never there.\n\n[FRAME: close-up, [CHAR_LIN]] [CHAR_LIN] holds the [PROP_LETTER]—folded rice paper, sealed with plain wax—as if it might dissolve. His lean face shows pure confusion, sun-touched brows drawing together, kind brown eyes searching the paper for explanation. His calloused thumb traces the seal. He lifts it to his nose unconsciously, catching the faint orchid scent. His lips part with a question that has no one to answer. The lantern light gilds his angular features, catching the gold flecks in his eyes. Instructions: read at evening. Evening is now.\n\n[FRAME: extreme-close-up, seal breaking] [CHAR_LIN]'s work-roughened hands—soil still visible under the nails—carefully break the wax seal. The sound is small but definite in the quiet shop: a soft crack of wax, a whisper of paper unfolding. The rice paper opens like a flower blooming, revealing elegant brushwork within. His fingers are gentle, treating the letter as he would a delicate cutting, something precious that might be damaged by carelessness. The orchid scent rises more strongly from the opened paper.\n\n[FRAME: medium, [CHAR_LIN] reading] [KEY_FRAME] [CHAR_LIN] draws the [PROP_LANTERN] closer, its warm light falling full on the [PROP_LETTER] and his wondering face. His lips move slightly as he reads, forming the words in silence. His expression transforms slowly—confusion to surprise, surprise to wonder, wonder to something that makes his eyes glisten. His breath catches. He reads: \"I have seen you every day...\" His hand rises unconsciously to the jade pendant at his throat—his mother's token, his one connection to love remembered. Outside, full dark has fallen. Inside, a new light dawns.\n\n---\n\n## Scene 5: The Game Begins\n[LOC_MEI_CHAMBER] - EVENING (PARALLEL TIME)\n\n[FRAME: wide, establishing] [KEY_FRAME] The [PROP_GO_BOARD] dominates the frame—nineteen by nineteen lines of fate mapped on aged mahogany. [CHAR_MEI] and [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] face each other across this battlefield, framed by bronze lamp glow against the chamber's deep shadows. The crimson bedding waits in soft focus behind them. The [PROP_SAVINGS_POUCH] sits beside the board like a witness. [CHAR_MEI]'s white stones have made first move. [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s thick fingers hover over his black stones, considering. The game has begun.\n\n[FRAME: close-up, stones placed] A black stone clicks against the board—[CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s move, aggressive, claiming territory. Then a white stone answers—[CHAR_MEI]'s counter, elegant but reactive. Click. Click. Click. The rhythm builds. The camera tracks the pattern emerging on the board: black advancing, white defending. Each stone is a word in their silent argument. The merchant's stones march forward with confidence; the courtesan's stones scramble to contain. Already, the game's shape tells a story of outmatched skill.\n\n[FRAME: medium, [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]] [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] radiates satisfaction. He leans back between moves, stroking his beard with jade-ringed fingers, small eyes crinkling with smug amusement. He knows Go; he has played this game in counting houses and tearooms across the empire. His bulk settles more comfortably into his cushion. He takes his time, savoring not just the victory forming on the board but the luxury of it—winning a beautiful woman through superior strategy. His belly moves with a silent chuckle. The outcome, to him, is already certain.\n\n[FRAME: close-up, [CHAR_MEI]'s face] [CHAR_MEI]'s porcelain features remain composed, but her eyes tell the truth: she is losing. A slight tightening around her mouth, the smallest furrow between elegant brows. Her fingers hover over the bowl of white stones, hesitating—a tell she would normally never show. The lamp flame reflects in her amber-brown eyes as twin points of light. She knows the board, knows the math, knows what's coming. But beneath the surface desperation, something else moves: calculation. The game on the board is lost. The larger game is just beginning.\n\n[FRAME: extreme-close-up, [CHAR_MEI]'s fingers on ribbon] [KEY_FRAME] [CHAR_MEI]'s hand rises from the white stones, not to play but to touch her hair—specifically, the crimson [PROP_HAIR_RIBBON] that binds her elaborate arrangement. Her fingers find the silk end, rest there for a heartbeat. Lamplight catches the deep red against her pale skin, the blue of her sleeve. A decision crystallizes behind her eyes. Her training, her weapon, her only remaining move. The ribbon waits to fall.\n\n---\n\n## Scene 6: The Gambit\n[LOC_MEI_CHAMBER] - EVENING (CONTINUOUS)\n\n[FRAME: medium, [CHAR_MEI] rising] [KEY_FRAME] [CHAR_MEI] rises from her cushion in one fluid motion—silk whispering, powder blue kimono falling in perfect lines. The movement is so graceful it seems rehearsed, yet carries genuine purpose. She reaches for the tea pot nearby, a legitimate excuse for proximity. [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] looks up from the board, surprised by her movement but pleased by the service. He doesn't see the subtle shift in her posture, the deliberate softening of her shoulders, the way her breath has changed.\n\n[FRAME: tracking, [CHAR_MEI] moving behind] [CHAR_MEI] glides around the table, [PROP_TEA_CUP] in hand, her path taking her behind [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]. Each step is calculated: close enough to warm the air, far enough to build anticipation. Her hand rises to her hair as she moves—a gesture that seems unconscious, simply adjusting. Her fingers find the crimson [PROP_HAIR_RIBBON]. The camera follows her like a falling leaf, slow and inevitable. She arrives at his shoulder.\n\n[FRAME: close-up, ribbon release] [KEY_FRAME] [CHAR_MEI]'s fingers pull the [PROP_HAIR_RIBBON], and everything changes. The crimson silk slides free in a rippling cascade. Her black hair—unbound, impossibly long—falls over her shoulder in a dark waterfall, cascading across [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s field of vision. Her orchid perfume, held close by the hair all evening, wafts across his face in a concentrated wave. The ribbon drifts down like a promise. Time seems to slow. His eyes widen.\n\n[FRAME: over-shoulder from [CHAR_MEI], pouring tea] From behind [CHAR_MEI], we see over her bare shoulder—kimono slipped slightly, pale skin glowing—as she leans to pour tea into [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s cup. Her hair brushes his ear. Her warmth presses soft against him. Steam rises from the amber tea. His face is visible past her profile: flushed, lips parted, eyes unfocused. The Go board, the game, the wager—all have vanished from his mind. There is only her: scent, warmth, proximity, the whisper of silk and hair and skin. His thick fingers grip his knees.\n\n[FRAME: extreme-close-up, [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s eyes] [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s small shrewd eyes have glazed over, pupils dilated, seeing something that isn't in the room. His mind has wandered—we know where, though we don't follow. The lamp flame flickers in his unfocused gaze. Sweat beads at his temple. His tongue touches his lip. He is somewhere else: imagining blue silk sliding from shoulders, crimson bedding receiving a pale body, pleasures purchased and possessed. The game board waits, forgotten. The moment stretches. [CHAR_MEI] has retreated to her seat, waiting. He reaches blindly for a stone.\n\n---\n\n## Scene 7: Victory and Freedom\n[LOC_MEI_CHAMBER] / [LOC_FLOWER_SHOP] - EVENING (INTERCUT)\n\n[FRAME: close-up, decisive move] [KEY_FRAME] CLICK. The sound of a stone placed—white stone, [CHAR_MEI",

Delicate brows arch like willow leaves above them. Her nose is small and straight, her lips full and naturally pink, trained in a thousand subtle expressions. Her hair is her crowning glory—a cascade of pure black silk that falls past her waist when unbound, usually arranged in elaborate styles held with jade pins and silk ribbons. Her neck is long and graceful, her shoulders slope elegantly, and her hands are small with tapered fingers, nails kept immaculate. Her figure is slender but curved, the result of dance training and careful diet. She moves with studied grace that has become second nature, each gesture a small performance.",

Her hair ribbon is deep crimson silk, a deliberate contrast to the cool blue, serving as both adornment and tool. Jade hairpins shaped like plum blossoms hold her elaborate hairstyle. Small gold earrings catch light at her ears. Her feet are bare in her private chambers, small and pale, though she owns embroidered silk slippers for formal occasions.

His skin is pale from spending his days in counting houses rather than fields, with age spots beginning to appear at his temples. His beard is carefully groomed, more gray than black now, trimmed to a point that he strokes when thinking. His hands are soft—merchant's hands that have never known labor—but his fingers are thick and strong from handling coins and account books. His eyebrows are bushy and expressive, often raised in calculation or lowered in concentration.

His hands tell his story best: strong and calloused from work, soil perpetually embedded under his nails despite washing, yet capable of extraordinary gentleness when handling delicate blooms. He is lean but not thin, with the wiry strength of labor—shoulders broadened from carrying pots and soil, forearms corded with muscle.

His feet are often bare in the shop or clad in simple straw sandals for the street.

He wears no jewelry except a small jade pendant on a cord at his neck, barely visible—his mother's, kept close to his heart.

Her face retains echoes of great beauty: strong bone structure, elegant brows, lips that know exactly how to curve for effect. But time has sharpened her features, thinning her cheeks, adding lines around eyes and mouth that speak of decades navigating the treacherous waters of the pleasure quarter. Her eyes are her most formidable feature: black and glittering, missing nothing, calculating everything. Her hair, now silver-streaked, is always impeccably arranged, lacquered into elaborate styles that add inches to her height. Her hands are manicured perfection, nails long and painted, though veins now show through papery skin. She is thin and straight-backed, refusing to bend to age, held together by will and whalebone. Her skin is pale and powdered, smoothing what cannot be hidden. Gold teeth flash when she smiles, replacements for those lost to time. She wears heavy perfume that announces her presence before she enters a room.",

She favors heavy gold jewelry: earrings, rings, pins, a statement of assets accumulated through shrewd management. A ring of keys hangs at her sash, the jangle announcing her approach.

Fine bamboo mats cover the floor, worn soft from years of careful footsteps. A polished mahogany table sits at center, low to the ground, meant for formal tea service or, tonight, a fateful game. Painted screens depicting cranes and pines divide the space and filter light. Scrolls of calligraphy and landscape paintings adorn the walls. A bronze mirror on a stand allows Mei to prepare her careful masks. Cosmetics boxes of lacquered wood line one wall. Most importantly, latticed doors lead to a small private terrace—Mei's window to the world, her observation post over Lin's flower shop below.

Shelves line every wall, each holding blooming miracles. The ceiling is low, strung with drying flowers hung upside down. In the back, a simple living space: a low table where Lin takes his meals, a rolled sleeping mat, a small shrine to his ancestors.

Mood: intrigue arriving, mystery delivered.",
    "4.3.cA": "Close-up of [CHAR_LIN] holding folded rice paper letter sealed with plain wax. Lean angular face of young Han Chinese man, approximately 25-28, with sun-touched bronze skin and warm brown eyes with golden flecks showing pure confusion. Straight brows draw together. Thick black hair falls across forehead. His calloused thumb traces the wax seal. He unconsciously lifts paper to nose, catching faint orchid scent. Pink lips part with unasked question. Lantern light gilds his features from side. Background: flower shop soft focus. Mood: wonder at mystery, gentle curiosity.",
    "4.4.cA": "Extreme close-up of [CHAR_LIN]'s work-roughened hands carefully breaking wax seal on letter. Soil visible under short nails, calloused palms, strong fingers capable of extraordinary gentleness. Rice paper unfolds like flower blooming, revealing glimpse of elegant brushwork within. Small scar crosses right thumb. Warm golden lantern light illuminates the paper's texture. Background completely blurred. The sound almost visible: crack of wax, whisper of paper. Mood: sacred moment, fragile truth being revealed, hands that understand delicate things.",
    "4.5.cA": "Medium shot of [CHAR_LIN] drawing paper lantern closer, warm light falling full on letter and his wondering face. Lean features transformed—confusion to surprise to wonder to glistening eyes. Lips move slightly forming silent words. His free hand rises to jade pendant at throat, unconscious gesture. Faded indigo tunic, disheveled black hair falling across forehead. Letter held carefully in work-roughened hands. Golden lantern creates intimate circle against shop's shadow. Orchids visible in soft background. Mood: revelation dawning, love letter comprehended, emotion overwhelming.",
    "5.1.cA": "Wide establishing shot dominated by wooden Go board—nineteen by nineteen lines on aged mahogany. [CHAR_MEI] in powder blue kimono and [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] in burgundy brocade face each other across this battlefield. Bronze lamp glow frames them against chamber's shadows. Crimson bedding waits in soft focus background. Cloth savings pouch sits beside board. White stones in one bowl, black in other—possibilities waiting. Oil lamp flame flickers between players. Tension visible in composition. Color palette: amber, blue, burgundy, crimson. Mood: battle of wits commenced, everything at stake.",
    "5.2.cA": "Close-up of Go board surface as stones are placed. Black slate stone clicking against aged mahogany grid—aggressive move claiming territory. White clamshell stone answers—elegant but reactive. Pattern emerging: black advancing, white defending. Visible hands at frame edges: [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s thick jade-ringed fingers placing black, [CHAR_MEI]'s delicate tapered fingers placing white. Board surface worn smooth with age, grid lines precise. Amber lamp light catches stone surfaces. Composition shows game's momentum favoring black. Mood: skill versus desperation, clicking rhythm of fate.",
    "5.3.cA": "Medium shot of [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] radiating satisfaction. He leans back between moves, thick jade-ringed fingers stroking pointed gray-streaked beard. Small shrewd eyes crinkle with smug amusement. Round fleshy face wears confidence like second skin. Burgundy silk brocade robes spread around his considerable bulk. He savors the moment—winning through superior strategy. Lamplight catches gold thread dragons. Go board visible in foreground, white stones struggling. Chamber's luxury surrounds him. Mood: predator certain of victory, premature satisfaction, underestimation.",
    "5.4.cA": "Close-up of [CHAR_MEI]'s face showing composed porcelain features betraying truth through eyes. Slight tightening around full pink lips, smallest furrow between elegant willow-leaf brows. Large amber-brown eyes reveal: she is losing. Her fingers hover over bowl of white stones, hesitating—a tell she would normally hide. Lamp flame reflects as twin points in her eyes. Elaborate black hair arrangement, crimson ribbon visible. But beneath desperation, something else moves: calculation forming. Powder blue kimono collar visible. Mood: apparent defeat, hidden strategy awakening.",
    "5.5.cA": "Extreme close-up of [CHAR_MEI]'s hand rising from white Go stones to touch her hair—specifically the crimson silk hair ribbon binding her elaborate arrangement. Delicate tapered fingers rest on the deep red silk against ink-black hair. Lamplight catches the ribbon's blood-red color against her pale wrist, the powder blue sleeve. Her jade hairpin partially visible. Decision crystallizes in the subtle tension of her fingers. Go board with losing position soft focus below. Mood: weapon identified, seduction mobilized, last resort reached.",
    "6.1.cA": "Medium shot of [CHAR_MEI] rising from cushion in one fluid motion. Powder blue silk kimono falls in perfect lines, whispering with movement. Young Han Chinese woman, porcelain skin glowing in amber lamplight. Movement is graceful, seemingly rehearsed yet purposeful. She reaches for nearby tea pot—legitimate excuse for proximity. [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] visible in soft focus, looking up from Go board with pleased surprise at the service. Her posture has subtly shifted—shoulders softened, breath changed. Crimson bedding visible in background. Mood: strategy deployed, seduction commencing.",
    "6.2.cA": "Tracking shot following [CHAR_MEI] gliding around mahogany table, porcelain tea cup in delicate hand. Her powder blue kimono flows with calculated movement, path taking her behind [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s burgundy-robed bulk. Each step measured: close enough to warm air, building anticipation. Her free hand rises to elaborate black hair arrangement. Fingers find crimson silk ribbon. [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s thick shoulders in foreground, unaware. Oil lamp light follows her movement. Go board visible, game paused. Mood: predator repositioning, weapon about to deploy.",
    "6.3.cA": "Close-up of [CHAR_MEI]'s fingers pulling crimson silk hair ribbon free. The deep red silk slides in rippling cascade. Her ink-black hair—impossibly long—falls over bare shoulder in dark waterfall, cascading across frame toward [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s field of vision. Orchid perfume visually suggested by her expression. Pale shoulder visible where powder blue kimono has slipped. Ribbon drifts down like promise. His ear and fleshy cheek visible at frame edge. Amber lamp light catches the silk's movement. Mood: everything changes, sensory weapon deployed, time slowing.",
    "6.4.cA": "Extreme close-up of [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s eyes glazed over, pupils dilated, seeing something not in the room. Small shrewd eyes now unfocused, lost in imagination. Lamp flame flickers reflected in his gaze. Sweat beads at his temple where age spots show. His tongue touches yellowed lip. Fleshy features slack with distraction. He has left the game entirely—mind wandered to fantasies. [CHAR_MEI]'s black hair barely visible at frame edge, her presence felt not seen. Mood: complete distraction achieved, victory approaching, predator becomes prey.",
    "7.1.cA": "Close-up of white Go stone being placed with decisive CLICK on aged mahogany board. [CHAR_MEI]'s delicate porcelain fingers—small, tapered, immaculate nails—press the polished clamshell stone into winning position. The board shows transformed game: white stones now triumphant over scattered black. Her powder blue silk sleeve visible. Amber lamp light catches the stone's smooth surface. Focus sharp on the decisive piece. Background blurred—chamber, opponent, stakes all secondary to this moment. Mood: victory seized, freedom won, click of fate decided."

Her voice—unheard but clear in her expression—lays out the wager. Her chin lifts slightly as she speaks, one of her confident tells. His eyebrows rise, first with surprise, then with amused interest. The lamp flame flickers between them. He leans forward; she remains perfectly still. His thick finger points at her, then at the board, then at the pouch. His belly laugh shakes his frame—he thinks this game already won.\n\n[FRAME: extreme-close-up, hands shaking] [KEY_FRAME] [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s thick jade-ringed hand engulfs [CHAR_MEI]'s delicate fingers as they shake on the wager. The contrast is stark: his pale fleshy palm against her slender porcelain fingers, his rings against her bare skin, merchant weight against courtesan grace. The deal is struck. In his grip, her hand disappears entirely, yet her fingers don't tremble. The lamp casts their joined hands in sharp shadow against the polished table. A game of Go. Her freedom. His amusement. Everything.\n\n---",
