  "logline": "A courtesan at a legendary brothel risks everything in a high-stakes game of Go to win her freedom and pursue true love with a humble florist who doesn't know she exists.",
  "synopsis": "Mei, the prized courtesan of the prestigious Lu Xian brothel, has been groomed since childhood in the arts of intellect, seduction, and pleasure. As she comes of age, two powerful suitors compete for her purchase: General Zhoa, a high-ranking military officer, and Min Zhu, a wealthy merchant with a gambling addiction. However, Mei has secretly fallen in love with Lin, a gentle florist whose shop sits below her window, watching him tend to his flowers with devoted care from her bedroom terrace.\n\nDesperate to escape her predetermined fate, Mei approaches the merchant Min Zhu with a proposition: she will wager her life savings in a game of Go. If she wins, he must match her payment so she can buy her own freedom. If she loses, she will sell herself to him at a discount. As they play the fateful game, Mei realizes she is outmatched and resorts to using her seductive training to distract him, ultimately securing victory through cunning rather than skill. With her freedom won, she sends Lin a heartfelt letter confessing her love and admiration, then races barefoot through the dirt streets to his shop, where he waits with her note in hand, ready to begin their new life together.",
  "themes": "Freedom vs. fate, true love transcending social barriers, sacrifice and risk for authentic connection",
  "world_rules": "Set in historical East Asia (likely China), this world operates under rigid social hierarchies where courtesans are property to be bought and sold. The Lu Xian brothel represents the pinnacle of refinement, where courtesans are educated in high culture, music, poetry, and strategy games like Go. Social mobility is extremely limited, with clear distinctions between merchants, military officials, courtesans, and common tradespeople like florists. Honor-bound agreements and gambling debts carry serious social weight. The setting features traditional architecture with wooden buildings, bamboo furnishings, silk textiles, and paper lanterns, suggesting a pre-industrial society where craftsmanship and personal skill are highly valued.",
  "lighting": "Warm, golden lantern light contrasted with cool moonlight streaming through windows, creating intimate pools of illumination against deep shadows that suggest both secrecy and romance",
  "vibe": "Intimate, romantic, tension-filled, bittersweet",

      "name": "Mei",
      "role": "protagonist",
      "description": "Mei possesses an ethereal beauty with delicate, porcelain-like features and luminous skin that seems to glow in lamplight. Her long, silky black hair cascades past her shoulders like liquid obsidian, often adorned with ornate pins and ribbons. Her almond-shaped eyes are deep brown, expressive and intelligent, framed by naturally arched brows. She moves with practiced grace, every gesture refined through years of training. Her slender frame carries itself with poise, though there's a subtle tension in her shoulders that betrays her inner turmoil. A small beauty mark near her left temple adds to her distinctive allure."

      "description": "Lin has a lean, wiry build from physical labor, with calloused but gentle hands that speak to his dedication to his craft. His black hair is often tousled from working outdoors, sometimes with small leaves or petals caught in it. His warm brown eyes are observant and kind, with laugh lines that suggest quiet joy rather than boisterous humor. His skin is lightly tanned from hours in the sun, and he often has soil under his fingernails. There's an earthiness to his presence, as if he carries the essence of growing things with him. A small scar on his left hand from a pruning accident shows his dedication to his work."

      "description": "Min Zhu is a stocky, well-built man with the soft edges that come from a life of luxury and rich food. His round face is dominated by calculating dark eyes that seem to appraise everything they see. His black hair is always perfectly groomed and oiled, with a neatly trimmed beard that he strokes when thinking. His hands are soft and manicured, adorned with expensive rings that catch the light. He carries himself with the swagger of someone accustomed to getting his way, chest puffed out and chin raised. A gold tooth glints when he smiles, and his skin has the pale complexion of someone who spends most time indoors conducting business."

Her graying hair is always styled in elaborate arrangements with ornate combs and pins that signify her status. Her dark eyes are sharp and assessing, missing nothing in her domain. She maintains excellent posture despite her age, moving with the grace of someone trained in the same arts she teaches. Her hands are well-maintained but show the subtle signs of age, often adorned with jade bracelets that chime softly when she gestures. Fine lines around her eyes speak to years of careful observation and calculation."

Her black hair is always pulled back in a simple braid, practical rather than decorative. Her dark eyes are alert and intelligent, though she keeps them downcast in the presence of authority. Her skin shows the effects of hard work and little sun, and she moves with the efficient economy of someone whose time is never her own. Despite her humble appearance, there's a quiet dignity in her bearing when she thinks no one is watching."

His black hair is streaked with distinguished gray at the temples and kept in a severe, regulation style. His dark eyes are cold and calculating, accustomed to sizing up opponents and obstacles. His face is weathered from campaigns but well-maintained, with a carefully groomed mustache that adds to his authoritative appearance. Scars on his hands and a faint mark on his jaw speak to his combat experience. His presence commands attention and respect through sheer force of personality and physical intimidation."
