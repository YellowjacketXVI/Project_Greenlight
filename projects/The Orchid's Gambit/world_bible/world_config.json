  "synopsis": "In the bustling merchant district outside the imperial palace of feudal China, the renowned Lixuan Brothel houses the most coveted courtesans in the city. Among them is Mei, a young woman of exceptional beauty and virtue who yearns for genuine love beyond the transactional relationships that define her existence. From her ornate balcony room, she watches Lin, a dedicated florist across the street, tend to his orchids with the kind of devotion she craves for herself.\n\nDesperate to escape her circumstances, Mei devises a daring gamble with General Zhoa: if he wins at Go, he can marry her at a reduced price, but if she wins, he must purchase her freedom. During their fateful match, Mei employs subtle seduction to distract the general\u2014serving tea with intimate proximity, allowing her presence to cloud his strategic thinking. As Zhoa becomes lost in fantasies of possessing her, Mei secures her victory on the board.\n\nWith her freedom won, Mei crosses the street to Lin's flower shop, where the florist recognizes her as the woman who has watched his orchids with such longing. As he welcomes her inside, Mei finally steps into a world where she might be cherished for who she truly is, not merely for her beauty or entertainment value.",
