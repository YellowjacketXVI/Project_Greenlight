  "logline": "A prized courtesan on the eve of being sold to the highest bidder risks everything on a game of Go to win her freedom and pursue the humble florist she has silently loved from afar.",
  "synopsis": "In the renowned pleasure house Lu Xian, Mei has been raised as the establishment's most precious jewel\u2014trained in intellect, seduction, and the arts of pleasure. Now of age, she faces the inevitable auction of her body and future to wealthy suitors. Two powerful men remain in contention: General Zhoa, a high-ranking military commander, and Min Zhu, a gambling-obsessed grand merchant. Yet Mei's heart belongs to neither. From her terrace, she has spent countless hours watching Lin, the gentle florist across the street, tend to his flowers with such devotion and care that she has fallen deeply in love with a man who has never once seen her face.\n\nDesperate to escape her gilded cage, Mei approaches the merchant Min Zhu with a dangerous wager: if she defeats him at Go, he must match her life savings and purchase her freedom. If she loses, she becomes his at a discount. The merchant, amused by her audacity, accepts. During their fateful game, Mei realizes she is outmatched and deploys the only weapons she has been taught\u2014her beauty and allure. With a calculated gesture of loosened hair and whispered proximity, she clouds his judgment long enough to secure victory. As the merchant pays for her freedom, Mei sends a heartfelt letter to Lin confessing her secret devotion. She runs barefoot through the night to his shop, where he sits reading her words by lantern light, and when he opens the door to find her standing there\u2014wild-haired, breathless, and free\u2014a new life begins.",
  "themes": "Freedom versus ownership, the courage to pursue authentic love, using one's constraints as tools for liberation, the poetry of silent devotion",
  "world_rules": "This story exists within Imperial China's rigid social hierarchy, where courtesans occupy a complex position\u2014educated and refined yet ultimately property to be bought and sold. The pleasure house Lu Xian operates under strict codes: Madame Chou controls all transactions, and courtesans cannot leave without being purchased. Wealth determines access, and suitors must negotiate through formal channels. The game of Go serves as both intellectual pursuit and metaphor for strategic maneuvering in a society where women must use indirect means to achieve agency. Honor and agreements are binding\u2014once a wager is made, it must be honored regardless of outcome. Class boundaries are rigid but not impermeable; freedom, once purchased, is absolute.",
  "lighting": "Golden hour warmth contrasted with intimate candlelit interiors; soft lantern glow casting amber shadows; diffused daylight filtering through silk screens and wooden lattice",

      "description": "Mei possesses an ethereal, willowy beauty standing at modest height with a graceful, elongated neck that draws the eye upward. Her hair is lustrous black silk that falls past her waist when unbound, typically arranged in elaborate styles adorned with jade pins. Her eyes are dark pools of liquid amber, almond-shaped with a slight upward tilt, framed by delicate brows she has learned to arch expressively. Her skin is pale as moonlight on snow, meticulously maintained with rice powder and pearl cream. Her lips are naturally full, often tinted with subtle rouge. She moves with practiced elegance, each gesture a poem, yet there's an underlying stillness about her\u2014a quality of watching, waiting, yearning. Her hands are small and impossibly soft, trained for the qin and calligraphy."

He stands at average height with a lean, wiry build developed through daily labor\u2014carrying water, turning soil, climbing to prune high branches. His hair is black but sun-lightened to deep brown at the ends, typically pulled back in a simple topknot that often loosens throughout the day, sending strands across his forehead. His eyes are warm brown, the color of rich earth, with gentle crow's feet beginning at the corners from squinting in sunlight. His face is kind rather than striking, with a strong jaw softened by full lips that curve easily into unconscious smiles when he works. His hands are his most notable feature\u2014strong and calloused yet capable of impossible delicacy, with soil perpetually embedded beneath his short nails. His skin is tan from outdoor work, with a scattering of small scars on his forearms from thorns."

His face is weathered and hard, with deep lines carved by sun, wind, and the weight of command. A prominent scar runs from his left temple to his jaw\u2014a sword cut he wears with pride. His eyes are black and penetrating, the eyes of a man accustomed to reading battlefields and judging men's worth in seconds. His hair is iron-grey, worn in a severe topknot appropriate to his station. His jaw is square and often clenched, his lips thin and rarely smiling. His hands are calloused from sword and reins, his knuckles scarred from combat. He moves with controlled power, every gesture economical and purposeful."

She is of medium height, her figure still shapely though fuller than in youth, carried with impeccable posture. Her hair is silver-white, always elaborately styled and pinned with valuable ornaments that advertise her success. Her eyes are dark and shrewd, with the knowing look of someone who has seen everything and been surprised by nothing. Fine lines web her face, particularly around her eyes and mouth\u2014evidence of both smiles and sorrows. Her hands are elegant, adorned with rings, though age spots mark them. She moves slowly now, deliberately, each gesture conserving energy while projecting authority."
