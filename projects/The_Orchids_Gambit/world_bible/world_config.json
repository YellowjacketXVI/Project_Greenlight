Her face is an elegant oval with high cheekbones that catch light like carved stone. Her eyes are her most striking feature: large, dark pools of liquid amber-brown, framed by naturally curved lashes, capable of conveying innocence and knowing seduction in the same glance. Delicate brows arch like willow leaves above them. Her nose is small and straight, her lips full and naturally pink, trained in a thousand subtle expressions. Her hair is her crowning glory—a cascade of pure black silk that falls past her waist when unbound, usually arranged in elaborate styles held with jade pins and silk ribbons. Her neck is long and graceful, her shoulders slope elegantly, and her hands are small with tapered fingers, nails kept immaculate. Her figure is slender but curved, the result of dance training and careful diet. She moves with studied grace that has become second nature, each gesture a small performance.",
      "costume": "Mei wears a powder blue silk kimono of exceptional quality—the blue soft as morning sky, the silk so fine it whispers with her movements. The garment is embroidered with subtle white orchid patterns along the hem and sleeves, visible only when light catches the thread. A darker blue obi sash cinches her waist, tied in an elaborate bow at her back. Beneath, layers of white and pale pink undergarments peek at collar and wrists. Her hair ribbon is deep crimson silk, a deliberate contrast to the cool blue, serving as both adornment and tool. Jade hairpins shaped like plum blossoms hold her elaborate hairstyle. Small gold earrings catch light at her ears. Her feet are bare in her private chambers, small and pale, though she owns embroidered silk slippers for formal occasions.

His face is round and fleshy, with small shrewd eyes that have calculated countless deals and measured innumerable risks. Deep lines bracket his mouth from a lifetime of smiling while negotiating. His skin is pale from spending his days in counting houses rather than fields, with age spots beginning to appear at his temples. His beard is carefully groomed, more gray than black now, trimmed to a point that he strokes when thinking. His hands are soft—merchant's hands that have never known labor—but his fingers are thick and strong from handling coins and account books. His eyebrows are bushy and expressive, often raised in calculation or lowered in concentration. Despite his bulk, he moves with surprising confidence, a man accustomed to rooms parting for his wealth. His teeth are yellowed from tea and tobacco. His ears are large, lobes stretched from heavy jade earrings he wore in his younger, more ostentatious days.",

His outer robe is rich burgundy silk brocade, heavy with gold thread embroidery depicting dragons chasing pearls—traditional symbols of power and fortune. The fabric alone costs more than most families earn in a year. Beneath, he wears layers of fine cotton and silk in cream and gold. His sash is thick black silk, holding a jade toggle carved into a prosperity symbol. Heavy jade rings adorn three fingers, and a gold chain at his neck suggests a hidden pocket watch—a Western affectation marking him as a man of international trade. His shoes are black silk with thick white soles, kept pristine by servants who carry him in a palanquin. A subtle fragrance of sandalwood and tobacco clings to his robes.

His face is lean and angular, with high cheekbones and a strong jaw softened by a gentle expression. His skin is sun-touched from hours working among his plants, a warm bronze that speaks of honest outdoor labor. His eyes are kind, deep brown with golden flecks visible in sunlight, framed by straight brows and subtle laugh lines that suggest a man who finds joy in his work. His hair is thick and black, usually tied back simply with a cord while working, occasionally falling across his forehead when he bends to tend his flowers. His hands tell his story best: strong and calloused from work, soil perpetually embedded under his nails despite washing, yet capable of extraordinary gentleness when handling delicate blooms. He is lean but not thin, with the wiry strength of labor—shoulders broadened from carrying pots and soil, forearms corded with muscle. His posture is naturally good, spine straight from work that requires careful attention rather than brute force. A small scar crosses his right thumb from a childhood accident with pruning shears. His smile, rare but radiant, transforms his face completely.",

Simple brown cotton trousers, rolled at the ankle, show soil stains at the knees from kneeling. A worn leather apron with pockets holds his tools during work. His feet are often bare in the shop or clad in simple straw sandals for the street. In evenings, he removes the apron but rarely changes—the same humble tunic, perhaps a gray cotton jacket against chill. He wears no jewelry except a small jade pendant on a cord at his neck, barely visible—his mother's, kept close to his heart.

Her face retains echoes of great beauty: strong bone structure, elegant brows, lips that know exactly how to curve for effect. But time has sharpened her features, thinning her cheeks, adding lines around eyes and mouth that speak of decades navigating the treacherous waters of the pleasure quarter. Her eyes are her most formidable feature: black and glittering, missing nothing, calculating everything. Her hair, now silver-streaked, is always impeccably arranged, lacquered into elaborate styles that add inches to her height. Her hands are manicured perfection, nails long and painted, though veins now show through papery skin. She is thin and straight-backed, refusing to bend to age, held together by will and whalebone. Her skin is pale and powdered, smoothing what cannot be hidden. Gold teeth flash when she smiles, replacements for those lost to time. She wears heavy perfume that announces her presence before she enters a room.",

Painted screens depicting cranes and pines divide the space and filter light. Scrolls of calligraphy and landscape paintings adorn the walls. A bronze mirror on a stand allows Mei to prepare her careful masks. Cosmetics boxes of lacquered wood line one wall. Most importantly, latticed doors lead to a small private terrace—Mei's window to the world, her observation post over Lin's flower shop below.

Shelves line every wall, each holding blooming miracles. The ceiling is low, strung with drying flowers hung upside down. In the back, a simple living space: a low table where Lin takes his meals, a rolled sleeping mat, a small shrine to his ancestors.

      "appearance": "A perfect stem of white Phalaenopsis orchid, five blooms open in graduated sizes, each flower like a face turning toward light. The petals are waxy white with faint yellow centers, impossibly delicate. The stem is strong and green, supported by a thin bamboo stake. The pot is simple terracotta, the soil dark and rich. This orchid sits on Mei's terrace railing, tended with stolen techniques observed from watching Lin—her secret practice of his craft, her tribute to his teachings.",
      "significance": "The bridge between Mei and Lin's worlds. She tends this orchid with everything she's learned from watching him, her love expressed in cultivation. It represents what she wants: to be cared for as Lin cares for his flowers, to be nurtured rather than possessed, to bloom rather than be bought."
