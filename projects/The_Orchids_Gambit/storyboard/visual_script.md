## Scene 1: The Jewel of Lu Xian
[LOC_BROTHEL] - EVENING

[FRAME: wide, establishing] [KEY_FRAME] The legendary [LOC_BROTHEL] blazes with warm amber light against evening darkness. Silk banners flutter from eaves as golden glow spills from every window. Wealthy patrons in fine silk ascend stone steps past red-lacquered columns carved with golden dragons. Oil lanterns in silk shades cast pools of honey-colored light across the opulent interior where courtesans glide between low tables.

[FRAME: medium, [CHAR_MADAME_CHOU]] [CHAR_MADAME_CHOU] surveys her domain from a raised platform, plum-purple robes resplendent with gold phoenix embroidery. Her kohl-lined eyes sharp as blades, painted red lips curved in cold satisfaction as she watches two wealthy suitors across the hall.

[FRAME: two-shot, suitors] [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] in burgundy silk with gold embroidery sits opposite a military general, both men's hungry gazes fixed on the performance stage. The merchant's ringed fingers drum the table impatiently, pouchy face gleaming in lantern light.

[FRAME: wide, performance stage] [KEY_FRAME] On the raised platform, [CHAR_MEI] dances in flowing cerulean blue silk, her movements liquid poetry. The crimson ribbon in her black hair traces her motion through candlelight. She is the establishment's most precious jewel—and she is for sale.

[FRAME: close-up, [CHAR_MEI] eyes] Behind the practiced seduction of her dance, [CHAR_MEI]'s deep brown eyes hold hidden depths of melancholy. For a fleeting moment, her gaze drifts toward the window—toward the night beyond these gilded walls.

## Scene 2: The Florist's Garden
[LOC_FLOWER_SHOP] - MORNING

[FRAME: wide, establishing] [KEY_FRAME] Dawn light washes over [LOC_FLOWER_SHOP] on the corner, its wooden panels folded back revealing an explosion of color—orchids, chrysanthemums, flowering branches in tall ceramic vases. Morning mist clings to the pressed dirt road as [CHAR_LIN] emerges carrying a wooden bucket of water.

[FRAME: medium, [CHAR_LIN] working] [CHAR_LIN] moves among his plants with quiet devotion, simple hemp robe sleeves rolled past his tanned forearms. His honest face wears an expression of gentle concentration as he tilts each pot toward strengthening sunlight, loose black hair escaping his topknot around his temples.

[FRAME: extreme-close-up, hands tending orchid] His work-roughened hands move with surprising delicacy, calloused fingers brushing soil aside to check roots, the old scar on his thumb catching morning light. He handles a white orchid as if it were the most precious thing in the world—because to him, it is.

[FRAME: insert, pruning shears] Small iron pruning shears clip precisely—a single brown leaf falling away. He lifts the pot to eye level, murmuring softly to the flower, adjusting its position where dawn light will nurture it best.

[FRAME: medium, [CHAR_LIN] smiling] [CHAR_LIN] straightens, wiping soil-stained hands on his canvas apron, a soft genuine smile crossing his features as he surveys his thriving plants. He has no idea he is being watched.

## Scene 3: The Watcher Above
[LOC_TERRACE] - MORNING (CONTINUOUS)

[FRAME: wide, terrace from street level] [KEY_FRAME] High above the flower shop, [CHAR_MEI] stands on [LOC_TERRACE], silk robe rippling in morning breeze. She is silhouetted against pale sky, delicate hands resting on carved wooden railing, her gaze fixed downward on [CHAR_LIN] below.

[FRAME: close-up, [CHAR_MEI] watching] [CHAR_MEI]'s face is unguarded in this private moment, stripped of courtesan performance. Her deep brown eyes are soft with longing as she watches [CHAR_LIN] tend his flowers. Her rose-pink lips part slightly, breath catching.

[FRAME: pov, from [CHAR_MEI]] Her perspective looking down—[CHAR_LIN] visible through morning mist, moving gently among blooms, his kindness evident in every gesture. The distance between them perhaps thirty feet—and an entire world.

[FRAME: extreme-close-up, [CHAR_MEI] eyes] Unshed tears glimmer at the corners of her eyes, catching dawn light. In [CHAR_LIN]'s gentle care of his flowers, she sees everything she has never known—tenderness without transaction, love without conditions.

[FRAME: wide, both figures] [KEY_FRAME] Split composition—[CHAR_MEI] in upper frame on moonlit terrace, [CHAR_LIN] below surrounded by flowers. Two people in the same frame who have never truly met, separated by the gulf between their worlds.

## Scene 4: The Gambit Proposed
[LOC_BROTHEL] - AFTERNOON

[FRAME: wide, private reception] [KEY_FRAME] [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] reclines on silk cushions in a private chamber, servants at the walls, lacquered trays of delicacies before him. [CHAR_MEI] enters through silk curtain, movements deliberate, cerulean robes immaculate—but her eyes hold calculation matching his own.

[FRAME: medium, [CHAR_MEI] kneeling] [CHAR_MEI] sinks into position across the low table from [CHAR_MIN_ZHU], setting [PROP_MONEY_BAG] on the polished wood between them. The heavy silk pouch bulges with her life's savings. "Master Min Zhu. I am told you are a gambling man."

[FRAME: close-up, [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] intrigued] Interest sharpens [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s pouchy features. He leans forward, belly straining against gold brocade, small eyes calculating. His thick finger taps the table beside the money bag. "A wager? From Lu Xian's most precious jewel?"

[FRAME: close-up, [CHAR_MEI] speaking] "A game of Go. If you win, I sell myself to you at discount—everything I have plus my willing compliance." Her voice is honey and silk, but her eyes are steel. "If I win, you match my savings. I purchase my own freedom."

[FRAME: reaction, [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] laughing] [KEY_FRAME] [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] laughs, jowls shaking, wine-stained lips spread wide in amusement. His ringed hand slaps the table. "A courtesan thinks she can defeat me at the scholarly arts?" His eyes gleam with greed and anticipated victory. "Agreed. Tomorrow evening."

## Scene 5: The Letter Sent
[LOC_MEI_CHAMBER] - AFTERNOON

[FRAME: wide, chamber interior] [KEY_FRAME] Afternoon light filters through rice paper screens as [CHAR_MEI] kneels at her dressing table, ink brush poised over [PROP_NOTE]. Her hand trembles slightly. This letter holds everything—her heart, her hope, her desperate gamble on love.

[FRAME: extreme-close-up, brush on paper] Black ink flows in elegant characters across cream rice paper: "I have seen you every day, and yet I know you have never seen me. I have watched you love your flowers in every way, and I have come to know my love through you..."

[FRAME: insert, letter text continuing] "...I ask that you accept me and treat me like your flowers every day and teach me how you love. Know I will give everything I have for that opportunity. From the terrace over your shop—Mei."

[FRAME: medium, [CHAR_SERVANT] receiving letter] [CHAR_MEI] folds the paper carefully, sealing it with red wax. She presses the [PROP_NOTE] into [CHAR_SERVANT]'s small hands, gripping them firmly. "To the florist on the corner. He must read it only at evening. Only at evening."

[FRAME: close-up, [CHAR_MEI] face] [KEY_FRAME] As [CHAR_SERVANT] slips away, [CHAR_MEI]'s composure wavers. Her fingers rise to touch [PROP_RIBBON] in her hair—her nervous tell betraying the magnitude of what she has set in motion. Everything depends on tonight.

## Scene 6: The Game
[LOC_MEI_CHAMBER] - EVENING

[FRAME: wide, game setup] [KEY_FRAME] Candlelight flickers across [LOC_MEI_CHAMBER] as [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] enters, finding [CHAR_MEI] waiting on fine bamboo mats. Between them sits the mahogany table bearing [PROP_GO_BOARD], black and white stones gleaming in their wooden bowls. The game begins.

[FRAME: insert, Go stones clicking] Black stone clicks against wood. White responds. The rhythm of play fills the room—precise, strategic, each move a battle. [CHAR_MEI]'s elegant fingers place stones with trained grace, but the merchant's position grows stronger.

[FRAME: close-up, [CHAR_MEI] worried] Sweat glistens at [CHAR_MEI]'s temple as she studies the board. She is outmatched—his experience overwhelming her tutored knowledge. Her fingers hover over her remaining stones, trembling. But she was trained in more than Go.

[FRAME: medium, [CHAR_MEI] rising with tea] [KEY_FRAME] [CHAR_MEI] rises gracefully, lifting [PROP_TEA_SET]. She moves behind [CHAR_MIN_ZHU], standing at his shoulder. Her fingers find [PROP_RIBBON], slowly untying it, letting her black hair cascade down, wafting her scent across his face.

[FRAME: extreme-close-up, tea pouring] She leans close pouring tea, her silk-clad bosom brushing gently against his ear. Steam rises between them. [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s breath catches, his pouchy eyes glazing as his mind wanders to forbidden imaginings—sliding silk from shoulders, red bedding, her legs pulling him close...

## Scene 7: Victory and Flight
[LOC_MEI_CHAMBER] - EVENING (CONTINUOUS)

[FRAME: close-up, decisive Go move] [KEY_FRAME] CLICK. A white stone strikes the board with finality. [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] snaps from his reverie to find the position transformed—his formations crumbling, his territory encircled. His small eyes widen with shock. He has lost.

[FRAME: reaction, [CHAR_MIN_ZHU] stunned] [CHAR_MIN_ZHU]'s fleshy face cycles through disbelief, fury, and finally grudging respect. His thick fingers grip the table edge, knuckles whitening. A bet is a bet. His merchant's honor demands payment.

[FRAME: insert, money exchange] [CHAR_MEI]'s elegant fingers push [PROP_MONEY_BAG] toward him. He adds matching coins and silver ingots. The combined weight represents her life—purchased not by another, but by herself. She watches him rise heavily, carrying payment to [CHAR_MADAME_CHOU].

[FRAME: medium, [CHAR_MEI] at door] [KEY_FRAME] [CHAR_MEI] stands at her chamber door, the brothel sounds fading behind her. She looks down at her embroidered silk slippers, then kicks them off. Her bare feet touch the cold floor—free feet, belonging only to herself.

[FRAME: wide, [CHAR_MEI] running] [CHAR_MEI] bursts through Lu Xian's entrance and runs across the pressed dirt road toward the flower shop corner. Her cerulean silk streams behind her, black hair wild in the wind, bare feet flying over packed earth. She is free—and she is running toward love.

## Scene 8: The Door Opens
[LOC_FLOWER_SHOP] - EVENING (PARALLEL / CONTINUOUS)

[FRAME: wide, interior with lantern] [KEY_FRAME] Inside [LOC_FLOWER_SHOP], [CHAR_LIN] sits at his small table, [PROP_LANTERN] casting warm amber glow across his gentle features. In his work-roughened hands, he holds [PROP_NOTE], unfolded, the elegant characters visible.

[FRAME: close-up, [CHAR_LIN] reading aloud] His lips move as he reads her words aloud: "I have watched you love your flowers in every way, and I have come to know my love through you..." His brown eyes widen, voice catching. "...From the terrace over your shop—Mei."

[FRAME: extreme-close-up, [CHAR_LIN] eyes] Emotion floods his honest face—wonder, disbelief, the dawning recognition that someone has seen him, truly seen him, and loved what they saw. His eyes glisten in lantern light.

[FRAME: medium, [CHAR_LIN] approaching door] KNOCK. KNOCK. [CHAR_LIN] startles, the note trembling in his hands. He rises slowly, heart pounding visible in his throat, and approaches the wooden door. His calloused hand reaches for the handle.

[FRAME: wide, door opening] [KEY_FRAME] The door swings open to reveal [CHAR_MEI]—bare feet on packed earth, hair blown wild across her face, cerulean silk catching lantern light. The most beautiful woman [CHAR_LIN] has ever seen stands breathless before him. She looks up, and she smiles. Behind her, orchids sway gently in the night breeze—flowers tended with love, waiting for their newest bloom.
