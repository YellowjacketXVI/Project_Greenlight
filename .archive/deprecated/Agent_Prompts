# ⚠️ DEPRECATED - DO NOT USE ⚠️

**This file has been deprecated as of 2025-12-13.**

## Replacement

Use `greenlight/agents/prompts.py` instead. The `AgentPromptLibrary` class provides:
- `TAG_NAMING_RULES` - Mandatory tag format instructions with concrete examples
- Tag validation prompts with proper prefix enforcement
- Director prompts with scene.frame.camera notation
- Location directional view prompts

## Why This Was Deprecated

1. **Placeholder formats:** This file used `[TAG_NAME]` placeholders instead of concrete examples like `[CHAR_MEI]`
2. **Missing prefixes:** Tag extraction prompts didn't enforce proper prefixes (CHAR_, LOC_, PROP_)
3. **No TAG_NAMING_RULES:** Missing the mandatory naming rules that ensure LLM compliance
4. **Inconsistent notation:** Didn't use the standardized scene.frame.camera notation

## Migration Guide

```python
# OLD (deprecated)
# Read prompts from Agent_Prompts file

# NEW (use this)
from greenlight.agents.prompts import AgentPromptLibrary

# Get tag naming rules (MANDATORY for all tag-related prompts)
rules = AgentPromptLibrary.TAG_NAMING_RULES

# Get specific prompts
prompts = AgentPromptLibrary.get_tag_validation_prompts()
```

```
Analyze the following text and identify locations that are significant settings or landmarks. Extract these as tags in the format `[LOC_TAG_NAME]`.

**Source Text:**
{{source_text}}
```

### 1.3. Character Defining Agent

```
Analyze the following text and identify elements that define a character's identity or development. Extract these as tags in the format `[CHAR_TAG_NAME]`.

**Source Text:**
{{source_text}}
```

### 1.4. World Building Agent

```
Analyze the following text and identify elements that establish the world's rules, culture, or history. Extract these as tags in the format `[CONCEPT_TAG_NAME]`.

**Pitch:**
{{pitch}}

**JSON Output Structure:**
{
  "protagonist": "",
  "goal": "",
  "antagonist": "",
  "conflict": "",
  "beats": [],
  "themes": [],
  "setting": ""
}
```

### 2.2. Layer 3: Prose Generation

      "characters": ["CHAR1", "CHAR2"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3.2. Camera Evaluator

## 4. Quality Check Agents (PROMPT 6)

These prompts are used by the `QualityCheckPipeline` to validate the generated storyboard prompts.

### 4.1. Symbolic Language Validator
